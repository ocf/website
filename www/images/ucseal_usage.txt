Hi Kenneth,

I've attached EPS files of both the "large" and "small" versions of the
Berkeley seal, with both color and black & white variations for each
version.  When the seal will appear *larger than* 1.5 inches, use SealLCL or
SealLBW, and when the seal appears 1.5 inches or smaller, use SealSCL or
SealSBW.  If you have any questions, or problems with the file format,
please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,
Jenifer Shelnutt

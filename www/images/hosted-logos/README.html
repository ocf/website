<h2>About these logos:</h2>These logos are for organizations that have requested <a href=/services/virthosting.html>virtual hosting</a>
with the OCF, or for anyone else that wants to use them.
The "metal" and "lighter" images were the original logos created by ceugene in 2000.
"binnov" was contributed by the student group <a href=http://innovation.berkeley.edu/>"Berkeley Innovation"</a> in 2003.
"ocf-hosting-flag-wave" was contributed by the student group <a href=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sca/>"Society for Creative Anachronism"</a> in 2005.
The "berknow" logo was created by AH Design Net for the student group <a href="http://ucbnow.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley NOW</a> in 2006.

If you would like to contribute your own logo design for the hosting services,
perhaps to better match the look and feel of your website, please contact the
Site Manager: sm@ocf.berkeley.edu

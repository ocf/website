<h2>About Our Organization</h2>


<!--<p align="center">Open Computing Facilitators.</p>-->

<h1>The Mission</h1>

The OCF is an all-volunteer, student-run, student-initiated service group
dedicated to free computing for all <!--A href="/UCB/"--><a
href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California at Berkeley</a>
students, faculty, and staff.  The mission of the OCF is to provide an
environment where no member of Berkeley's campus community is denied the
computer resources he or she seeks, and to appeal to all members of the
Berkeley campus community with unsatisfied computing needs and to provide
a place for those interested in computing to fully explore that interest.

<h1>What We Do</h1>

<p>
The Open Computing Facility provides free computing services to student, faculty, and staff, ranging from free printing to expiration-free web space to UNIX shell accounts to email. Furthermore, the OCF operates a highly frequented long-hours computing lab with a generally high volunteer-staff-to-user ratio for accessible in-person support, as well as online support. In addition to these user services, the group also hosts numerous <a href="/group_pages.shtml">student group websites</a>, and provides support to these and other organizations on campus.
</p>

<p>
To be able to do this, we are always aiming to secure more resources to fully meet the needs of everyone
in the campus community. <!--, and we do have enough to meet a large number of
them.--> Our primary resources are our UNIX and Windows workstations and UNIX servers &mdash; entirely administered by <a href="staff/">student volunteers</a>. These resources are located within our computing lab on the ground floor of Eshleman Hall.
</p>

<p>
To help people explore the field of computing and educate them about the resources
available, the OCF also provides a variety of educational services. We used to co-sponsor
a series of <!--<a href="/help-sessions">-->Help Sessions<!--</a>-->, short classes
taught throughout the semester on a wide range of computing topics, from beginner
to advanced levels, and focusing on resources available to the Berkeley campus
community.  These now take the form of <a href="/sysadmin-class">DeCal courses</a> offered by us. We also offer e-mail and in-person consulting with our volunteer staff
members, as well as online sources of information about computing on the Berkeley
campus and how to use the available resources. Additionally, the OCF has conducted <a href="../careerfair/">career fairs</a> in the past with its sister organization, the <a href="http://www.csua.berkeley.edu">Computer Science
Undergraduate Association</a><!--, catering almost exclusively to CS students-->.
</p>

<!--We have materials which could theoretically comprise a (a
href=lib/)library.-->

<a href="policies/">Policies</a> for this cluster and decisions for the OCF
organization are made by the OCF Board of Directors, a group of students elected
each semester by the OCF membership.  The Board meetings, held at least once every
two weeks when classes are in session, are open to the public and provide a chance
for any user to express their concerns or opinions about the OCF.

<blockquote>
The OCF is an all-volunteer, student-run, student-initiated service group
dedicated to free computing for all <!--A HREF="/UCB/"--><a
href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California at Berkeley</A>
students, faculty, and staff.  The mission of the OCF is to provide an
environment where no member of Berkeley's campus community is denied the
computer resources he or she seeks, and to appeal to all members of the
Berkeley campus community with unsatisfied computing needs and to provide
a place for those interested in computing to fully explore that interest.
We do our best not to be elitist.<p>

We are always securing more resources to fully meet the needs of everyone
in the campus community, and we do have enough to meet a large number of
them. Our primary resources are our <A href="machines/">UNIX
workstations</A> and UNIX servers -- mostly Sun Sparc -- that are
administered by <a href="staff/">student volunteers</a>, and located in
Heller Lounge (2nd level) of the MLK Student Union, as well as 72 Barrows
Hall. <p>

To help people explore the field of computing and educate them about the resources
available, the OCF also provides a variety of educational services. We co-sponsor
a series of <a href="/help-sessions">Help Sessions</a> which are short classes
taught throughout the semester on a wide range of computing topics, from beginner
to advanced levels, and focusing on resources available to the Berkeley campus
community.  We also offer e-mail and in-person consulting with our volunteer staff
members, as well as on-line sources of information about computing on the Berkeley
campus and how to use the available resources. <p>

The <a href=http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/>Computer Science
Undergraduate Association</a> is OCF's sister
organization<!--, catering almost exclusively to CS students-->. We
have put on <a href=../careerfair/>career fairs</a> in the past, with
and without them.<p>

<!--We have materials which could theoretically comprise a (a
href=lib/)library.-->

<A href="policies/">Policies</a> for this cluster and decisions for the OCF
organization are made by the OCF Board of Directors, a group of students elected
each semester by the OCF membership.  The Board meetings, held at least once every
two weeks when classes are in session, are open to the public and provide a chance
for any user to express their concerns or opinions about the OCF. <p>

<h2>How to Join OCF Staff</h2>


The <a href="/OCF/staff/">OCF Staff</a> is a group of student
volunteers responsible for the administration of the <a
href="/OCF/">Open Computing Facility</a>.  This includes helping users
with questions, answering staff mail, writing and compiling programs,
maintaining the OCF libraries, and writing documentation. Please note
that you do not need be able to do all of these tasks to be part of
OCF staff. All you need is the willingness to help others and some
time to commit. Many staff members adopt only a limited number of
responsibilities to accommodate busy schedules. We do not expect our
staff members to devote their whole lives to the OCF. The ability to
communicate with users and other staff members is probably the most
important prerequisite for becoming staff.

<p>

In addition to the day to day activities of maintaining our servers
and computer lab, many staff members work on team-based projects. Some
of these are short term, such as writing a program to collect user
feedback or new user documentation, and some are long term such as
installing, maintaining, and sometimes writing software. There are
even non-technical projects such as outreach to the student body by
making posters and flyering/tabling on Sproul. If you are interested
in working on a project at the OCF, older staff members can tell what
projects are already being worked on, and what else you would need to
know to get started on a project of your own.

</p>
<p>

Since the responsibilities of staff members are so varied, we welcome
people with all skills and majors to OCF staff. Extensive UNIX
experience is not required to join staff. However, the most helpful
UNIX skills for staff members are some knowledge of the command line and some experience with a text editor. 

</p>
<p>

We have an formal training program which takes about 30 minutes and
consists of instruction on the basic knowledge every staff member
should know:

</p>

<ol>
<li>Approving new individual and group accounts.</li>
<li>Finding and adding to OCF documentation on the wiki.</li>
<li>Working on the OCF's git repositories.</li>
<li>Printer maintenance.</li>
<li>Checking the print queue and de-queuing print jobs.</li>
<li>Chatting with staff on IRC.</li>
<li>Levels of OCF permission.</li>
<li>The structure of OCF leadership.</li>
<li>How to recruit and train new staff.</li>
</ol>

Beyond that, how much a staff person learns from being part of OCF
staff depends largely on how much that person wants to learn.

<p>

On the subject of learning, OCF staff is a great place to learn more
about the UNIX operating system and the resources of the
Internet. Among our rosters, we have staff members versed in a wide
variety of specialties, providing quality support to over 10,000 active users
despite our limited resources. There are opportunities to learn about hardware,
networking, and the Debian operating system.

</p>
<p>

As for the benefits, we don't pay,
but it can be quite educational, <a href="where-now.shtml">can look good on a
resume</A>, and can give you a "warm fuzzy feeling inside" knowing that you're
helping thousands of your fellow students.

<h2>The Open Computing Facility Staff</h2>

<h5>Who are we?</h5>

OCF Staff consists of UC Berkeley student volunteers from a variety of
majors, at various stages of academic ascendency at Cal.

<br />


<p></p>

<h5>What do we do?</h5>

We administer all of the OCF <a href="https://wiki.ocf.berkeley.edu/servers/">servers and
workstations</a> that serve our membership of over 10,000 students,
faculty, and staff affiliated with UC Berkeley. Elected officers guide
and coordinate major OCF activities on two fronts. The General Manager
is in charge of publicity, staff care and maintenance, and liaising
with the ASUC. On the other side of the fence is the Site Manager, who
heads up the hardware, software, and networking administration.

<p></p>

We have technical and non-technical positions that include helping
users with questions, answering mail,
installing and writing software, maintaining OCF information services,
upgrading hardware,

<a href="http://wiki.ocf.berkeley.edu/">writing documentation</a>

for the computing center, tabling on Sproul plaza for new users,
recruiting new OCF Staff members, updating our website, redefining
our graphical image, and more.

<p></p>

<h5>Who's in charge of OCF?</h5>

The everyday technical working of the OCF is under the supervision of
the OCF Site Manager, who is elected each semester by OCF's General
Membership.

<p></p>

Don't think that the Site Managers have total control, however &mdash; they 
don't. The General Manager is in charge of the Site Managers, other
OCF Staff, and the administrative, public relations, and human
resources of the OCF.

<p></p>

Lastly, in a final check and balance of the previous two titles is the
Board of Directors (BoD). It is under the BoD moniker that we
hold Board Meetings once a week.

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h5>When are staff available?</h5>

If you have any questions, please feel free to either e-mail

or talk to one of us in person in our lab during

<a href="/staff_hours">staff hours</a>. 

Often, staff may be around during non-scheduled hours, and even at
very odd hours.

<p></p>

<h5>How do I join staff?</h5>

Since we are all volunteers and because our current staff turns over
after several years due to graduation, we are always accepting new
staff members. If you are interested in contributing to the campus
computing community and getting some experience that will look good on
a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, read about <a href="how-to-join.shtml">how to join</a> 

OCF staff. We are not elitist, but we are elite. :) That said, check
where past staff have <a href="where-now.shtml">gone to work</a>.

<h1 align=center>Policy on Unattended Processes</h1>
<hr>
<i>As approved by the Board of Directors on February 22nd, 2000.</i>

<p>Shell access to OCF accounts is primarily intended for interactive
use. Because unattended processes divert resources from other
legitimate uses and can introduce security concerns, they are subject
to more restrictions than processes used interactively.

<p>Primary authority to regulate unattended processes is vested in the
Site Manager; as usual the decisions of the Site Manager can be
appealed through the OCF Decision Making Process.

<p><dl>
<dt>Unattended interactive processes<dd>

Normally interactive processes, including shells, xterms, and
applications such as mail-readers and web browsers, fall under the
scope of this policy when they are left idle for several hours or
more. Users who are connected to the OCF remotely may remain logged in
and running basic processes such as an terminal or an xbiff
indefinitely, as long as they take care to maintain their session's
security (for instance, a shell on the OCF should not be left
unattended in a public lab).  Users should try to avoid leaving major
processes such as a web browser for long periods, however, as they can
monopolize a large share of memory and other resources.  Unattended
processes are sometimes also created unintentionally, as by network
interruptions; staff may terminate these after a reasonable period if
they appear to be orphaned, and users who maintain permanent
connections must accept the possibility that their processes are more
likely to be terminated accidentally.

<p><dt>Computational processes<dd>

Because of the OCF's limited processing resources relative to its user
base, it is not especially suitable for uses that involve long-term
computation. However, such use of the OCF for individual purposes is
permitted, as long as the user makes a reasonable effort to avoid
interfering with the normal use of the OCF's facilities. In
particular:
<ul>
<li>Processes should run with a background priority (i.e., nice -19)</li>

<li>Processes should not be run on login servers (famine, conquest,
apocalypse)</li>

<li>There should be a file with the same name as the process but with
the extension `.info' in the user's home directory, describing what
the process does, and giving a graceful way to kill it, if doing so
should be necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p><dt>Collective computing efforts<dd>

Large external collected efforts, such as cipher-cracking, prime
number searches, and SETI@Home, are considered to be among the least
useful possible applications to which the OCF's computers can be put.
Especially because of many such efforts' competitive natures, they are
conducive to abuse and as such are more closely restricted. In
addition to the usual restrictions applying to computation processes,
such programs may only be run unattended after-hours on idle
workstations. Any such programs running unattended on login servers or
on workstations during lab hours may be killed.

<p><dt>Servers<dd>

Servers refer to a particular kind of processes that listen for
connections over a network and respond to requests for information or
other services. Note that servers that run only as part of an
application when a user is logged in (such as an X server, or a
networked game) do not fall under the provisions of this policy unless
they are left unattended.

<p>Because they respond to commands from the network and provide OCF
resources to outside parties, servers are troublesome from a security
standpoint. Servers that duplicate services already provided by the
OCF (such as a web server, file-transfer server or login server) are
particularly suspect because of their possible use to subvert normal
security and logging mechanisms, and will only be allowed with the
prior permission of the Site Manager.

<p>Servers that provide services not otherwise offered by the OCF may be
allowed under the following conditions:

<ul>
<li>Servers should not use excessive CPU power.</li>

<li>Servers should not be primarily for the use of individuals outside
the campus community.</li>

<li>When practical, servers should have access control and logging
mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use.</li>

<li>There should be a file with the same name as the process but with
the extension `.info' in the user's home directory, describing what
the process does, and giving a graceful way to kill it, if doing so
should be necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is suggested that users consult with the Site Manager before
putting such a server into permanent operation.

<p><dt>Network abuse and unattended processes<dd>

Users should also be especially careful with processes that connect to
other computers on the network as clients. If a program sends an
excessive number of unsolicited messages to other computers, such as
by email, in IRC, or even as ping packets, the user who ran it may be
held responsible for abuse of the network whether or not (s)he was
actively controlling the program at the time.

<h1>U. C. Berkeley Open Computing Facility User Behaviour Policy</h1>

The <A HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/ocf.html">Open Computing
Facility</A> exists to provide open computing to its members.  As OCF
members/account-owners, you have the right to use the machines on a
first-come/first-serve basis, on an equal footing with all other users.  
<p>
	OCF Members are allowed to use the machines for any purpose that they
want, including personal (not class) programming, personal communications,
reading/posting usenet news, collecting information or programs, or any other
normal uses of Unix computers.  They may use them in any manner that is not
specifically prohibited below. The OCF Board of Directors has made some 
special rules regarding using the cluster to Play Games during busy mid-day
hours, so that users wishing to do other activities will have the opportunity.
<p>
	OCF Members are not allowed to abuse the cluster or other persons.	
If your actions are causing problems with the rest of the user community, or 
with the cluster itself, OCF Staff can and will take action to stop you.
For minor problems you will be send email requesting you to stop.  For more
major problems, Staff can turn your account off.  Should you wish to appeal
any such actions, you should do so to the OCF Board of Directors (meetings
times and places are posted).
<p>
	What actions are 'causing problems'?  All of the following are
considered to be inapropriate actions:
<ul>
    <li> Harrasing other computer users, here or elsewhere
    <li> Interfereing with the normal operation of the OCF by software or
		actions (damaging the Operating System, system cracking, etc.)
		or by physical action (rebooting machines without Staff 
		approval).
    <li> Interfereing with other OCF users by interrupting or impedeing 
		their use of the cluster.
    <li> Using excessive amounts of diskspace.
    <li> Violating users' privacy.
    <li> Using the OCF for illegal activity (cracking into remote sites,
		sending chain letters, sending email threats, etc.).	
    <li> Harrasing OCF Officers or Staff (Asking OCF Staff questions or for help is not harrasing them.  That's their
job.)
</ul>
<p>
	Staff will generally give you the benefit of the doubt, unless we feel
you are intentionally causing problems.  Extreme infractions can be dealt with
by immediate account deactivation by staff if they feel it warranted.

<p>

	If you have any questions about OCF user policies, send mail to 
	gm@ocf or staff@ocf.  Staff generally handles enforcement, while the
	BoD makes policy.
<p>
Other behaviour may also qualify as causing problems.  You will be notified
if staff feels you are causing a problem.  If you feel you are being treated
unfairly then send mail to gm@ocf explaining your position.  If this does
not satisfy you, mail to bod@ocf is the next step, or showing up to a BOD
meeting to protest in person.
<p>
Thank you for your attention.  Please try and keep the OCF as friendly and 
useful cluster as possible.

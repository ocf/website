<p><I>[per OCF Board decision, 3/10/97]</I>

<LI>1.2) Obtaining access to the OCF resources<BR>

<UL>
<LI>1.2.1) All OCF account-holders must sign a form agreeing to abide by OCF
policies <I>[per OCF Board decision, 2/23/89]</I>, and agreeing not to
hold the University responsible for lost files or other misfortunes
which may result from their use of OCF services <I>[per Memorandum of
Understanding]</I>.

<LI>1.2.2) No user may be forced to pay any fees for use of the OCF services.
<I>[per Memorandum of Understanding]</I>

<LI>1.2.3) Membership in the OCF is not required for use of the OCF
services, nor does it provide any special privileges or entitlement to
OCF services.  <I>[per Memorandum of Understanding]</I>

<LI>1.2.4) Each OCF user may have one and only one account on the OCF
computers at any time.  Each OCF user must use their own account and
may not allow anyone else to use their account.  Each OCF user will be
held responsible for actions committed with their account.
<I>[per OCF Board decision, 2/16/89]</I>

<LI>1.2.5) OCF users may choose their own account names, but they must
be reasonably based on the user's real name.  <I>[per OCF Board
decision, 10/10/91]</I>

</ul>

<LI>1.3) Acceptable Uses of OCF resources

<ul>
<li>1.3.1) Possession of password-cracking programs on the OCF is
legitimate. Cracking passwords on the OCF is not a legitimate use of
the OCF or of the aforementioned programs, and can/will be sufficient
cause for staff to turn an account off. If staff sees somebody running
a password-cracking program, staff may ask that person to explain his
actions. He will have one week to explain them, and will not use the
mentioned programs during that one week under pain of account
termination. <i>[per OCF Board decision, 10/24/91]</i>

<li>1.3.2) Use of the OCF for an ongoing business is prohibited.
 Notice of such use will result in such use being stopped. 

</ul>


<LI>1.4) Allocation of limited OCF resources

<ul>
<li>1.4.1) Each user shall be allowed to use up to 5 megabytes of
	disk space, including storage for files in home directories,
	mail spools, and files available via OCF servers
	<i>[per OCF Board decision, 9/18/96]</i>.  Waivers extending this
	limit may be requested from the OCF Disk Usage Management
	Board <i>[per OCF General Meeting decision, 2/28/96]</i>.

<li>1.4.2) Each user shall be allowed to print up to 250 pages per
	semester.  After this limit is reached, further printing
	privileges may be obtained via a procedure to be determined
	by the Site Manager.  <i>[per OCF Board Decision, 2/11/93]</i>

</ul>
</ul>

<h2>2) Policies governing group accounts</h2>
<I>[this section is per OCF Board decisions on 10/30/89, 10/14/93,
and 10/18/94, an OCF Site Manager decision on 2/7/95, and Board decisions
on 2/29/2000 and 3/14/2001]</I>

<ul>

<li>2.1) Any group recognized by Student Activities and Services or
          sponsored by a university department may obtain a group account
          by contacting any OCF Staff Member.  Other organizations require the
          approval of the Board of Directors.
<ul>
<li>2.1.1) However, this policy shall not be interpreted as
           overriding the requirements of section 1.2.4. In particular,
	   the OCF Decision Making Process retains the right to grant
	   only one account to a student group, even to a group that
	   has registered as several organizations with the Office of
	   Student Life, if the purportedly separate groups are
	   substantially similar in membership and purpose.
</ul>

<li>2.2) Group accounts will be subject to a disk quota equaling the same
          amount as the regular user disk quota.

<li>2.3) Because group accounts create an opportunity for anonymous
          malicious hacking, OCF rule violations done with group accounts
          will be handled much more strictly than with user accounts.

<li>2.4) Group account passwords may not be distributed to people who
          aren't members of that group or who are not eligible for a
          personal OCF account.

<li>2.5) Group accounts must answer any mail they get from the system
          administration within a week.

<li>2.6) Group accounts must at all times have one user who is
          responsible for that group account, and must provide a
          non-email contact for that person (e.g., a phone number).

<li>2.7) Group accounts must be listed in a public file maintained by
          the Site Manager, currently 
          <tt><A HREF="gopher://gopher.ocf.berkeley.edu:70/00/OCF/Group_Accounts">/usr/local/OCF/Group_Accounts</A></tt>.

<li>2.8) Group accounts are intended to build a sense of community.
          Therefore, we also require groups to make the following
	  information available either in their <tt>.plan</tt> files
	  or on their web pages:
        <ul>
            <li> Description of the organization.
            <li> Ways to get involved with the organization.
            <li> How to get in touch with the person responsible for
                  the account.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>3) Policies governing OCF Staff</h2>

<dl>
<dt>3.1) Staff members shall be chosen by the OCF Decision Making Process.
<i>[per OCF Board decision on 4/13/89]</i>

</dl>


<I>[the rest of this section is per OCF Site Manager decision on 5/22/92]</i>

<dl>
<dt>3.2)  Flaming Policy
<dd>    Staff members should NOT flame users within their capacity as staff
    members or as a result of staff actions.  We've had cases when users who
    did not know what they were doing caused damage to the cluster.  We've
    also had cases when users flamed staffers for staff actions.  In both of
    these cases, while the temptation to flame back is high, the current
    site manager feels that it would be more beneficial to rationally
    address the user's concerns (or mistakes).  This way, the user may
    actually understand why he was wrong, rather than be alienated by a
    flame.  
<p>    Users should probably understand that this does NOT mean staff will
    never mail you and say "You REALLY screwed up."  It does, however, mean,
    that if we say you screwed up, we'll also try to make sure you
    understand how you screwed up.  We'll also refrain from using terms such
    as "Steaming Pile of Excrement. . ." :-)
<p>    Please understand, also, that while some staff guidelines are absolute
    (staff members who delete your directory because they don't personally
    like you WILL lose staff and superuser privileges, and probably get
    their accounts turned off), this guideline is a recommendation.  In
    other words, if a staff member does flame a user, the site manager will
    probably remind of the staff member of the policy, and repeated flaming
    could possibly get him gently shoved off staff.

<dt>3.3)  Privacy policy

<dd>Staff all have pretty similar ideas as to when to use root to look in a 
    user's account and when not to.  Generally speaking, if the user is
    a possibly serious threat to the cluster (if a staffer has seen them
    cracking passwords, logging in from various strange places WITHOUT
    explanation, etc. . .), staff  can use limited root to give his account a
    cursory glance.  Files, if possible, should NOT be read.  Their mail box
    should NEVER be read (a possible exception to this is the postmaster,
    but dpassage knows better than me the confines of his job, and staffers
    who remove strange characters in the mail box so it can be read, in
    which case, they should NOT read what is in the mail box). 
    If a user asks us a question which implies that he is granting staff
    permission to look in his files, fine -- we will look in his files.  In
    this case, however, we will only look in the relevant files.
    I realize this policy is vague.  It is intended to be vague, so staff can
    have the freedom of movement to execute the job efficiently.  Having a
    vague policy also means that staff can get away with more, and means that
    if I think a staffer abused the policy, probably nothing will happen to
    him.  The first time.  But I WILL make sure that staffer understands the
    limits of it, and that he NEVER EVER abuses it again.  

<dt>3.4)  Erasing Files

<dd>    There are only two possible reasons to erase files:
<ul>
<li>    A) The user has asked us to erase them (he may have had problems
       removing them himself, if they're called '-*&" for example)
<li>    B) The user has been over his quota for the length of time dictated by
       the current disk-quotas policy.  In this case, his files will be
       removed, starting from the biggest to the smallest, until he is under
       his quota.
</ul>
    There should be no other reasons to erase files.

<dt>3.5)  Maliciousness.

<dd>    The WORST thing a staffer could do is abuse root privileges.  Examples
    of this are improperly removing files, maliciously harassing users,
    maliciously logging people out, etc.  In cases like this, when the site
    manager decides that a staffer has acted maliciously, that staffer will
    be squished.  HARD.

<dt>3.6)  Authorization
<dd>    Staff is generally authorized to act independently of the SM in most
    situations.  This is so decisions do not have to be delayed by the
    bureaucracy of having to ask the SM for approval for all decisions,
    especially when sometimes staff needs to do something immediately, and
    the SM isn't around.
<p>    There are some things, however, that always require SM approval.  They
    are:
<ul>
<li>    1) Taking accounts off-line for more than the length of a reboot.  That
       is, accounts should not be erased or backed up to tape and made
       unavailable to their owners without the authorization of the SM or
       the explicit request of the owner of the account.
</ul>

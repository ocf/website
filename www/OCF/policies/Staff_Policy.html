<title>OCF Staff Actions Policy</title>

<h1 align=center><A HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/OCF/">UC Berkeley Open Computing Facility</A><br>Staff Actions Policy</h1>
<h3>Last Updated:  May 22, 1992</h3>

OCF Staff is a small group (usually less than 20 people) of dedicated
volunteers who care enough about the OCF to dedicated large portions of
their time to answering user questions and maintaining the highest possible
usability state in the OCF.
<p>
Most OCF Staff is trusted with superuser privileges.  This means that they
can read anything on the system, no matter how protected it is (unless it is
crypted).  It means that they can turn off people's accounts, read their
mail, erase their files, or log them off.
<p>
Because of this tremendous power, staff MUST follow certain guidelines.
These guidelines are in place to protect both the users and staff from
possible misunderstandings.  
<p>
There is currently no official Board of Directors policy regarding the
behavior of staff.  Therefore, this is left up to the site manager to decide.
<p>
The following are some guidelines that staff needs to follow.  Be aware of
them.  Please understand that some times staff may do something that you
disagree with.  In this case, you can either complain to whoever in the OCF
chain of command you wish to complain to, but it is generally recommended to
go from the bottom up.
<p>
The OCF chain of command (from the lowest to the highest):
<ul>
<li>OCF Staff (staff@ocf)
<li>OCF Site manager (sm@ocf)
<li>OCF General Manager (gm@ocf)
<li>OCF Board of Directors (bod@ocf)
<li>OCF general membership (you'll need to convene a special meeting for this --
                       read the constitution and bylaws)
</ul>
<p>
To the best of my knowledge, no matter has ever gone higher than the OCF
Board of Directors.

<h2>Staff Guidelines:</h2>

<dl>
<dt>A)  Flaming Policy
<dd>    Staff members should NOT flame users within their capacity as staff
    members or as a result of staff actions.  We've had cases when users who
    did not know what they were doing caused damage to the cluster.  We've
    also had cases when users flamed staffers for staff actions.  In both of
    these cases, while the temptation to flame back is high, the current
    site manager feels that it would be more beneficial to rationally
    address the user's concerns (or mistakes).  This way, the user may
    actually understand why he was wrong, rather than be alienated by a
    flame.  
<p>    Users should probably understand that this does NOT mean staff will
    never mail you and say "You REALLY screwed up."  It does, however, mean,
    that if we say you screwed up, we'll also try to make sure you
    understand how you screwed up.  We'll also refrain from using terms such
    as "Steaming Pile of Excrement. . ." :-)
<p>    Please understand, also, that while some staff guidelines are absolute
    (staff members who delete your directory because they don't personally
    like you WILL lose staff and superuser privileges, and probably get
    their accounts turned off), this guideline is a recommendation.  In
    other words, if a staff member does flame a user, the site manager will
    probably remind of the staff member of the policy, and repeated flaming
    could possibly get him gently shoved off staff.

<dt>B)  Privacy policy

<dd>    Staff all have pretty similar ideas as to when to use root to look in a 
    user's account and when not to.  Generally speaking, if the user is
    a possibly serious threat to the cluster (if a staffer has seen them
    cracking passwords, logging in from various strange places WITHOUT
    explanation, etc. . .), staff  can use limited root to give his account a
    cursory glance.  Files, if possible, should NOT be read.  Their mail box
    should NEVER be read (a possible exception to this is the postmaster,
    but dpassage knows better than me the confines of his job, and staffers
    who remove strange characters in the mail box so it can be read, in
    which case, they should NOT read what is in the mail box). 
    If a user asks us a question which implies that he is granting staff
    permission to look in his files, fine -- we will look in his files.  In
    this case, however, we will only look in the relevant files.
    I realize this policy is vague.  It is intended to be vague, so staff can
    have the freedom of movement to execute the job efficiently.  Having a
    vague policy also means that staff can get away with more, and means that
    if I think a staffer abused the policy, probably nothing will happen to
    him.  The first time.  But I WILL make sure that staffer understands the
    limits of it, and that he NEVER EVER abuses it again.  

<dt>C)  Erasing Files

<dd>    There are only two possible reasons to erase files:
<ul>
<li>    A) The user has asked us to erase them (he may have had problems
       removing them himself, if they're called '-*&" for example)
<li>    B) The user has been over his quota for the length of time dictated by
       the current disk-quotas policy.  In this case, his files will be
       removed, starting from the biggest to the smallest, until he is under
       his quota.
</ul>
    There should be no other reasons to erase files.

<dt>D)  Maliciousness.

<dd>    The WORST thing a staffer could do is abuse root privileges.  Examples
    of this are improperly removing files, maliciously harassing users,
    maliciously logging people out, etc.  In cases like this, when the site
    manager decides that a staffer has acted maliciously, that staffer will
    be squished.  HARD.

<dt>E)  Authorization
<dd>    Staff is generally authorized to act independently of the SM in most
    situations.  This is so decisions do not have to be delayed by the
    beaurocracy of having to ask the SM for approval for all decisions,
    especially when sometimes staff needs to do something immediately, and
    the SM isn't around.
<p>    There are some things, however, that always require SM approval.  They
    are:
<ul>
<li>    1) Taking accounts off-line for more than the length of a reboot.  That
       is, accounts should not be erased or backed up to tape and made
       unavailable to their owners without the authorization of the SM or
       the explicit request of the owner of the account.
</ul>
</dl>
<p>

sm@ocf.

<H3>OCF Virtual Web Hosting Policies:</H3>

<ul>

<li>
The OCF will perform virtual hosting for the OCF group accounts. For
virtual hosts within the <i>berkeley.edu</i> domain, the group account
must apply to the <a href="http://ist.berkeley.edu">campus IS&T</a>
for a permission to be able to host their site on the OCF web server.
The OCF also hosts several non-<i>berkeley.edu</i> domains. However,
the application process is more complicated in this case. The permission
will be grated only for group accounts that can demonstrate a unique need
for having a web site outside of the <i>berkeley.edu</i> domain. For such
domains, the group account must:
<ol>
<li>
apply to the OCF Board Directors for a permission to host this domain.
<li> pay any and all fees and/or obtain the permission involved in
obtaining and maintaining a domain name.  No .com domains are allowed.
</ol>

<li>
Virtual web sites, just like other OCF user accounts, must comply with the
relevant UC Berkeley computer use policies including but not limited
to the <a href="http://amber.berkeley.edu:5014/">Policies and
Guidelines for Publishing on the World Wide Web at the University of
California, Berkeley</a>

<li>
All virtual web sites hosted on the OCF must include an OCF banner on
their front page that links to the OCF front page. In the case if the
banner is removed, the OCF reserves the right to terminate the virtual
hosting service.
</ul>


<H3>Getting started:</H3>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Sign up for an OCF group account if you haven't already done so.
<li>
Send an email message to the
<a href="mailto:hostmaster@nic.berkeley.edu">IS&T DNS administrators</a>
asking for a permission on host a virtual web site on the OCF web server.
Explain them the mission of your group.
<li>
If IS&T approves your request, send a note to the
<a href="mailto:sm@ocf.berkeley.edu">OCF site manager</a> asking to setup
a virtual host for your group account. It should take between one and
two weeks to setup a new virtual host.

<li>The files in the public_html directory of the group account will
appear at the root directory of the virtual site.

<li>All mail addressed to your virtual host/domain will be forwarded to your
group account. You can forward the mail sent to different addresses in
your virtual host by using .forward files. For example, if you have
a file named <i>.forward+webmaster</i> in your group account, all mail sent
to <i>secretary@virthost</i> will be processed using the directions
in this files. For example, you can put a real webmaster address(es) in
the .forward+webmaster file and it will be forwarded to her. All other mail
will be delivered to the group account mailbox.

<li>
Right now, no separate log files are being kept for virtual hosts.
However, we do collect the overall site usage statistics for the OCF
which be viewed at <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/stats">this</a>
URL.
<li>To place the OCF Banner on your page add the following HTML code at
the bottom:

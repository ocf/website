<title>Open Computing Facility Group Accounts Policy</title>
</head><body>

This is the Official OCF Policy on Group Accounts as approved by the Board of
Directors on October 30, 1989 and amended on October 14, 1993, and October 18,
1994.
<p>
<ul>

<li> Any group recognized by Student Activities and Services or
	  sponsored by a university department may obtain a group account
	  by contacting the Site Manager.  Other organizations require the
	  approval of the Board of Directors.

<li> Group accounts will be subject to a disk quota equaling the same
	  amount as the regular user disk quota.

<li> Because group accounts create an opportunity for anonymous
          malicious hacking, OCF rule violations done with group accounts
          will be handled much more strictly than with user accounts.

<li> Group account passwords may not be distributed to people who
	  aren't members of that group or who are not eligible for a
	  personal OCF account.

<li> Group accounts must answer any mail they get from the system
          administration within a week.

<li> Group accounts must at all times have one user who is
          responsible for that group account, and must provide a
          non-email contact for that person (e.g., a phone number).

<li> Group accounts must be listed in a public file maintained by
	  the Site Manager, currently 
	  <tt><A HREF="gopher://gopher.ocf.berkeley.edu:70/00/OCF/Group_Accounts">/usr/local/OCF/Group_Accounts</A></tt>.

<li> Group accounts are intended to build a sense of community.
          Therefore, we also require the following information in
          their <tt>.plan</tt> files:
	<ul>
	    <li> Description of the organization.
	    <li> Ways to get involved with the organization.
	    <li> How to get in touch with the person responsible for
                  the account.
</ul></ul>

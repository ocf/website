&gt; 
&gt; Yes.  IS&amp;T can't even afford to pay salaries to their own employees
&gt; competitive with the surrounding industry.  If it's any consolation,
&gt; it's not unique to Berkeley.  The Chronicle of Higher Education did
&gt; an article recently about the problems all universities are experiencing
&gt; in providing computing/network infrastructures to students, and
&gt; retaining experienced IT personnel in the face of the high demand
&gt; for such in industry.  The capital costs for extending computing facilities
&gt; for students are high (as are maintenance costs), and these costs
&gt; are hitting universities at almost the exact same time that federal
&gt; and state funds are drying up.  A nasty situation that does not,
&gt; unfortunately, show any signs of abetting soon.

My .02+:

I think that the University has plenty of money. Didn't I just read in the
Daily Cal a few days ago that they increased salaries for lots of high
level administrators ( I believe it was the Chancellor or the Regents or
somebody...)?

It's all a question of where the University chooses to spend it. Berkeley
_can_ afford to put lots of money into this branch of technology. This is
something that the administration has _chosen_ not to do. Obviously demand
far outstrips supply. They have simply _chosen_ to not keep up with it.
Granted, they don't have enough money to make all the problems magically
disappear, but they do have enough to make it work. Personally, I believe
they misspent the technology grant on wiring classrooms. Why? How often
are you in a particular classroom versus how often are you at home?
Actual class time is limited and only to the wishes of the Professor in
the class.

(As long as we're talking about mismanagement of resources, I remember
hearing somewhere that even during peak time there were 10 or so unused
modems in the faculty pool. It would be easy, as aid to a temporary
solution, to let students have access to those lines, and kick them off if
needed by faculty. I'm sure people would be more than happy to do so.)

I also have experience from another University where dial-in net access
wasn't such a big deal. The main differences were, however, that were
plenty of on-campus facilities, some open 24/7, as well as the fact that a
larger percentage of the students lived on campus, with Ethernet
connections provided. Granted, it was also a smaller university, but then
their budget was also smaller. This university needs to either have more
on-campus housing, or more on-campus computer facilities. Or, I don't
know, let students hook up ethernet in their apartments.

Questions, comments, and smart remarks welcome.

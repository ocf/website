Certainly, the University is not obligated to provide modems
nor textbooks for students as you correctly pointed out.
However, the University does have the funds to provide
certain services that it considers useful to the campus
community - such as a shuttle bus, night escort service,
etc.  To say that the "whining" over the modems is silly
and ill-conceived, just because you don't think the
University should provide that service, is stupid.

The campus could easily run a proxy server for such services, or could
contract out a service on the campus network to an outside vendor.  But the
faculty modems were paid for by a grant specifically for faculty modem
access, so I don't think it would be possible to pull the plug on them.
I essentially agree with Ryan, however, that the idea of a campus modem
bank being an entitlement is nonsensical.  Someone's gotta pay for it,
and it seems reasonable that it should be the people using it.

: At what point was this option given to students?

in order for a fee like this to be implemented by students, you would need
a campuswide referendum, possibly either through asuc senate action (hah)
or (x)x,000 signatures on a petition. then you would need a 2/3ds campus
vote.

: The obvious response, of course is that I don't use my phone to do my
: homework, where I do use University computers via modem to do so.  (I
: admit this response ignores the many people using the modems for
: non-class-related purposes.)

the phone is needed to register for classes at uc berkeley, so it
certainly could be considered an essential (even required) part of
education at cal -- yet phone service is not provided by uc if you're not 
in the dorms. and *i* don't need modems to do *my* homework -- why should
i pay for your modem? (esp. considering that cs/eecs/hard science
departments get far more private donations and grants than humanities
departments. the last thing we need is to throw _more_ money at cs/eecs.)

and while is&amp;t may be able to offer internet access for half the price of
a typical isp, i have little confidence it will will offer anywhere near
the same quality of service. such should not be expected from an academic
bureacracy of any sort, especially at a public school. (not to say is&amp;ters
aren't capable on an individual level, but is&amp;t the entity is a university
department -- it is not structured like a business and shouldn't be
expected to function as one. maybe it should become an 'auxilliary
enterprise' like tsw or h&amp;d or what the asuc store was to become.)

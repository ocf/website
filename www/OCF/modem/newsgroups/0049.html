&gt; in the dorms. and *i* don't need modems to do *my* homework -- why should
&gt; i pay for your modem? (esp. considering that cs/eecs/hard science
&gt; departments get far more private donations and grants than humanities
&gt; departments. the last thing we need is to throw _more_ money at cs/eecs.)



For those who are taking CS/EECS classes and majors have special
dedicated
lines that are less busy (although the problem exist there as well). 
So adding
more modems to the general line isn't really for the sake of the
CS/EECS folks.

But most of information obtained from the internet service is
definitely
not for education and class purposes.  I think restricting the modem
lines to only
be able to access the Berkeley domain would solve many of the issues
that were raised
before.

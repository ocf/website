: Wrong.  If one dials in to a Berkeley campus modem to access Berkeley
: campus resources, and dials in to an off-campus provider to access
: off-campus resources, then one has no problems regardless of what
: Sprintlink does or doesn't do.  I may well pay $10/month for access to

so the best solution to the sprintlink problem is this -- every student
shells out for an isp *and* the university upgrades and expands the modem
pool just in case we need to access the campus network from the other
side?? this is certainly a smart strategy for an individual who wants
reliability, don't get me wrong, but certainly the campus as a whole could
fix this problem more cheaply by going to the root of it and getting
(somehow) a more reliable connection to the outside world.

: I think you show a remarkable lack of concern for those whose primary
: need is to access machines on the Berkeley campus, whether to do their
: homework or get their assignments or even waste time in newsgroups like
: this one.  (OK, so not many people *need* to do that.)

no -- i show a lack of concern for those who -- while moneyed enough to
buy a computer -- cannot shell out $15/month for dial-up access and demand
that the university provide it for free.

further, let's get real. we're not talking about despondent multitudes od
students wailing in grief as their modem redails for the millionth time
because they can't get their english paper assignment or post their
thoughts on machiavelli to ucb.class.ps* or get the realaudio feed of
a lecture at ucsd. we're talking about people who want to surf the web,
download the latest navigator beta, check out the dunkin doughnuts home
page and generally have a good time. and they have the money to buy modem
service if need be. they just don't want to. they want a free ride.

the only students who really really need reliable, 24 hr. net access for
academic purposes, i'd venture, are in the cs and eecs depts., and have
their own modems anyway. the rest of us can a&gt; log on at 10 am instead of
10 pm b&gt; haul our asses into an on-campus facility or c&gt; buy dial-up
access at a nominal cost.

the whining over 2 hour modem time limits and suggestions of rationing or
charging for campus modem use are silly and ill-conceived. if ucb hadn't,
as a key part of the internet in its pre-commercial days, offered modem
access to students and faculty, no one would have the gall to suggest it
has any duty to do so now.

it doesn't.

no more than it is obliged to pay for students' books, personal computer,
cable service, backpack, bluebook, notebook paper or any other key
instrument of higher education. no more than uc provides the (non-dorm)
telephone service that is so vital to registering for classes from
anywhere but campus.

the cost of using a private internet service provider is nominal --
especially when compared to the substantial cost of purchasing the pc and
modem that neccesitate such access in the first place. why put up such a
fight to avoid paying $80/semester (on the high end) for private dial-up
access? and does anyone doubt that a *private* isp will give you more bang
for your buck than the university would?

campus administrators should avoid the painful, screeching complaints of
spoiled student netizens and opportunistic campus politicos by bravely
stating right here and now that they have no obligation -- or further
intention -- of providing dial-up internet access. 

pull the plug on the modems for both students and faculty now. the core
competencies of the university, the forces of the market and the nature of
technological evolution dictate that it must happen eventually. best to
avoid a loud, painful, annoying (&amp; costly) transition by expediting the
process.

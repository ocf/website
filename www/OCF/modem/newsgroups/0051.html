&gt; I would think that's the worst solution I've heard yet.  (As well as

I don't understand this remark.  What's technically impossible, or even
difficult, about a packet filtering solution that only allows
connections from the modem pool to Berkeley IP addresses?  While I'm not
particularly supporting the suggestion, I don't understand how this
would "cut off access" for anyone.

&gt; About half of the web pages I visit for class-related work are
&gt; off-campus - why should I lose access to those just because some other
&gt; people are using the modems to visit www.tons-of-porn.com or
&gt; www.online-games.com?

Does the UCB library deliver books to your home, or do you have to go to
it to use its resources?  You could still use on-campus resources
exactly as you do now.

&gt;Now I understand what you [Alan] are saying.  You aren't saying that it's

&gt;there would be widespread abuse of means to circumvent that limitation.
&gt;I don't know if that's true or not.  I tend to doubt it---especially
&gt;since it wouldn't be that hard to detect---

No, it would be almost impossible to detect.  For instance, I have an
EECS instructional account, just as thousands of other students have
departmental and/or course accounts...

So now I have web access, and I can also, of course, telnet anywhere
else I want from the instructional machines.  The fact that there are
any multiuser systems at all on campus which can be used interactively
means that any of these systems can be used by people who came in
through a restricted annex to access services anywhere else.

To make it even easier:

I have SLiRP on my home machine (which is connected via an In-Room
Connection from Rescomp).  If my machine counts as being in berkeley.edu
(which it certainly is), or being on the Berkeley subnets (which it
certainly is), I could just give people accounts with SLiRP as a login
shell, and then they could dial in to one of these restricted
dialups, telnet to my machine, and have an unrestricted PPP connection.
All the packets would appear to be coming from my machine; it would
be impossible to distinguish between this and my regular use of the
computer.

You can run SLiRP on instructional and academic machines, too,
although it's likely to be against their rules.

This is even ignoring web proxies, which Alan Coopersmith mentions.  If
I put up a web proxy on my machine, pages there will appear to be
"Berkeley web pages" (in the sense of "being requested from an
on-campus server"); true, CNS or IST could notice that someone was
excessively requesting packets from my machine and start sniffing them
and seeing what was in them, but this would take a lot of work, and
it could be gotten around anyway.  For example, sometime I am going to write
a proxy which uses encrypted URLs, to try to defeat keyword and
location-based filtering and blocking systems (not at Berkeley, just in
general).

I personally think that attempts to control what people do with their
dialups once they connected to them are ignoring the big questions about
how many dialups there should be and who should pay for them and whether
there should be time-usage limits on them.  After all, what gets debated
in the _Daily Cal_ now is really a policy question and not a technical
question.

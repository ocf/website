Hi,
Several things:

1)  I want to identify the person who, from on high, made the decision that
    we will impose a 2 hour time limit on the general access (read "free")
    modem pools.

    That person was me:

	Clifford W. Frost
	Director
	Communication &amp; Network Services
	UC Berkeley
	<a href="mailto:cliff@uclink.berkeley.edu">cliff@uclink.berkeley.edu</a>
	510-642-5360
    
    For some reasons why, see below.  What it all comes down to is that I
    cannot justify not giving this a try.

2)  I'm happy for the discussion that's happening on this group, it is
    healthy, and discussions like it have often helped me and many others
    learn things over the years.  In true bureaucratic style, I'm leaving
    town next week for a (long-planned) week's vacation, sigh.

    Although I have given my email address and phone number above, I'd
    prefer to have the conversation in this forum, so everyone can see it.

3)  Why do this?  This takes 3 major forms:

	A)  It will make X difficult or impossible.  There are many different
	    "X"s.  Downloading large files, staying logged in to work on
	    certain kinds of long projects (eg a system administrator fixing
	    a broken system).  Someone may lose lots of work by being cut off
	    suddenly.

    Yes, that is correct.  On the other hand, obviously we cannot support
    every legitimate use of the modems.  The choice is to aim for allowing
    more people to use the modems to accomplish a more restricted set of
    tasks.  Reading email, some web browsing, downloading files up to 
    moderate size, are examples that come to mind.

    People with serious needs to do more than we can support with the free
    modems will have to find other ways to accomplish their work.  There are
    a number of computer labs around campus with high bandwidth connections
    to the Internet, and some people may have to make more use of these
    facilities than before.

    System administrators may require a paid service in order to do their work.

    I'm afraid I have a hard time with the lost work notion.  It's been very
    many years since I used an editor that didn't autosave.  I know that
    people have all sorts of scenarios where this will happen, but I'm
    confident that most of them have relatively straightforward workarounds.
    In other words, no one has to lose work because of this.

	B)  There is no evidence that this will actually help more people
	    access the modem supply, so the result will be inconveniencing
	    people and not helping anything.

    This is debatable.  There is evidence from at least one other University
    that it does, indeed, help.  
    
    We simply cannot say for sure that it won't help.
    
    I believe the level of the problem is such that we have NO EXCUSE for
    not trying this out.  This happens to be a method that is trivial to
    implement and has been widely requested, which makes it all the more
    compelling to try.  

	C)  It is pointless to restrict connections to two hours because
	    it's easy to simply redial and get back in, so it won't be
	    effective.

    Not if we impose rationing--limiting accounts to X hours/day or
    week.  And this is a likely next step.

    Also, I believe this argument is largely obselete.  10 years ago it was
    clearly true--a large proportion of modem users took great pleasure in
    outwitting various access restrictions.  But in the last 5 years the
    technical sophistication of the modem user population has drastically
    changed.  Today's typical user is not interested in the low-level
    technology--they want to accomplish other things.
    
4)  Now, take (A), (B), and (C) above and think about them together.

    If it is true that a large number of people will be unable to do
    certain kinds of work because of the time limit, then some number of
    these people will find alternatives for doing their work.  This will
    clearly cause many more people to be able to use the modems.

    If there are not a large number of people affected, then it won't help
    many more people use the modems.  But then it won't be that bad to
    have the time limit.

    I don't particularly like the notion of inconveniencing people with
    the time limit if it doesn't do any good.  On the other hand, there
    are hundreds of people who are seriously inconvenienced right now
    without the time limit.  The aim is to provide a useful service to
    the largest number of people--not to provide a perfect service to
    a more restricted number of people.

	Thanks,
		Cliff

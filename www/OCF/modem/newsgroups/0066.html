&gt; I can see how, for a text session sending one-char-per-packet, there
&gt; might be a significant difference between a telephone modem connection
&gt; depending on whether it originated on or off campus. What significance
&gt; slower response times would have for a much larger series of
&gt; applications, from straight data transfers to streaming audio, is yet
&gt; again a different question -- though I'd suggest that using a TCP
&gt; utility to tweak one's waits/waters/timeouts would do much to improve
&gt; this...

Certainly it *should* be possible to tune a connection to manage very
high data rates despite high latency, if packets aren't being dropped.
This is harder in practice than in theory, though.

And I would suggest that interactive response is much much more
important than streaming audio.  In fact I'd probably be happier if
streaming audio over the Internet didn't work at all, freeing it up for
more sensible uses.  But of course that's a personal bias.

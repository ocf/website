I'm very sympathic to the *concept* that providing Internet service to
off-campus students is something that private companies should do rather
than the university, just as providing phone service to those students
is something that private companies should do rather than the
university.

I think there are a couple of practical issues that are often ignored,
though.  And I'm not sure that the Internet is mature enough yet that
that concept is really ready for implementation.

One issue is the quality of the connection to campus resources.  In an
ideal world, your access to all parts of the net would be equally good
wherever you dial in.  In the real world, the net has a lot of
congestion and dropped packets.  Sprintlink (the sole connection to UC
Berkeley?) has more than its share.  Anyone attempting to access
university computers from the Internet has to put up with whatever
congestion exists on that network.  If the primary goal is to provide
access to *campus* resources, then it's better to dial in to campus and
therefore be on the same local network, then to dial in to an outside
ISP and have to come in over Sprintlink.

The other is the security issue of using one's address as an identifier
of whether one is associated with the university.  This applies to
outside services which UCB has licensed, and it also applies to
on-campus services which only respond to UCB addresses.  These are not
insoluble problems, but if UCB were to want to move to a policy of
primary off-campus access, then they need to be addressed.  In general,
as sites with firewalls have found, encouraging off-campus access is
inconsistent with providing security for campus computing.  It's not yet
clear how most large sites and institutions are going to handle this
tradeoff.

   BERKELEY:   OFFICE OF THE ASSOCIATE VICE CHANCELLOR
   INFORMATION SYSTEMS &amp; TECHNOLOGY
   209 EVANS HALL # 3812


   September 22, 1997

TO:   Chancellor's Cabinet

FROM: Jack McCredie
   
SUBJECT: Background about the UC Berkeley Modem Issue


The modem problem

As the use of electronic information resources becomes more important,
students, faculty, and staff demand ever more sophisticated access to
these resources both from on campus and from their residences. During the
past five years, IST has quadrupled the number of on-campus high-speed
network connections. Although we have also increased the number of free
dial-in modem lines, the demand for these lines outstrips our ability to
provide them at no charge.

With more than 40,000 individuals eligible for free modem service in our
campus community, the costs of providing high quality remote dial-in
service are at least $2M per year. IST currently is able to spend only
about $400,000 - $500,000 per year on this subsidized service. Obviously
there is a large gap between these numbers.

The present solution

IST currently provides a three-tier service for individuals who want to
access the campus network from off campus.

(1)   A pool of several hundred free modems (two hour time limit for
regular service, and 15 minute time limit for express service).
(2)   Arrangements with Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide
discounted commercial quality services to members of the campus community
(~$15 per month)
(3)   Arrangements with ISPs to provide higher capacity special services
at discounted prices, e.g., Metricom wireless service (~$20 per month),
ISDN, cable modems, etc.


What other UC campuses are doing

Last week, at a regular systemwide meeting of my counterparts at UC
Campuses (JOG), each campus representative gave a brief update of their
campus modem service options. All campuses have similar policies in place
with the usual slight variations due to local conditions.

…  All (except for San Diego) continue to have a free modem pool. Some
have restrictions like the recent Berkeley 2 hr per session limit, or the
10-hour per week limit at Santa Cruz. All report that this service is
overcrowded with busy signals the norm during prime time. Only UCLA
reports recently adding new lines to this service.
   
…  All have a second tier "pay for service" option available with a
recommended vendor that provides a special price for campus users
   
…  Several have a third tier of "special services" available such as
Metricom wireless (Berkeley and Santa Cruz), ISDN, cable, etc.

The prices for the second tier service vary from $10 to $15 per month.
Only San Diego has this service without a first tier free option. San
Diego has a $3 per month low usage plan available in addition to their
standard $10 per month offering.

The prices per month for the second tier service are:

Berkeley             $15 (commercial options going to ~ $10 internal
service later        this fall)
Davis                      $10
Irvine                     $15
Los Angeles       $10
Santa Barbara     $15
Santa Cruz     $10
San Diego      $10 (normal use; 3 low use; no free option)
San Francisco     $15
Riverside               $12

UC is not alone in these policies. Many campuses throughout the country
charge for dial-in service or have a technology fee for students.


Berkeley improvements scheduled for this fall

IST has never suggested that we should, and is not now proposing that we
will, remove the free modem service for students and staff. Our
implementation plans for this calendar year include (1) upgrading the
present free dial-in service to bring obsolete modems up to modern levels,
and (2) reducing the price (to approximately $10 from $15-20 per month)
and increasing the "tier two" options available for individuals who choose
to purchase a higher grade of service than we can provide through the free
modem pool. We will continue to adjust the time limits and the mix of
timing options available in order to provide a fair and equitable set of
free services to the campus community.

The IT Committee, the CCCPB, and the Academic Senate Committee on
Computing and Communications have discussed this issue many times during
the past few years. IST has improved remote access to both the campus
network and the Internet in recent years, but the dial-in problem remains
acute due to rapidly escalating demands. Current Berkeley solutions depend
on students and staff bearing some of the costs. Even though student ASUC
leadership remains opposed to any student charges, the IT committee, the
CCCPB, and the Senate continue to recommend cost sharing approaches to
this problem. 

Most members of these committees believe that with its limited University
resources, IST investments should be used to develop (a) the best
on-campus infrastructure possible, (b) better campus connections to the
Internet, (c) additional campus networked information resources, and (d)
general instructional technology support for better teaching and learning
environments.

Summary

Berkeley's policy of providing free access for tier one service, and a
modest recharge (about 30 cents per day) for no-busy-signal tier two
service, and additional tier three high performance options is scalable,
reasonable and affordable. This fall, IST will be making significant
improvements to both the tier one and tier two service offerings.

Additional background

…  From 1992-94, IST approximately doubled the number of dial-in ports
available to the campus. However, we realized that there was not enough
money available to solve completely the modem problem while making the
significant budget reductions required by the state funding cutbacks (note
that IST received cuts to its base budget totaling more than 20% during
fiscal years 93-97).
   
…  About this time, commercial Internet Service Providers (ISPs) started
selling economical and robust access services in the free market. IST
negotiated favorable contracts with companies such as Netcom and Metricom
(wireless modem service) and encouraged students and staff to take
advantage of these services. 
   
…  In 1994, IST also announced a recharge modem service for campus groups.
This service required groups to self organize and IST did not market it
successfully. One important group did take advantage of this service in a
major way - the faculty. They lobbied through the Academic Senate to have
a separate restricted modem pool, and the Chancellor's Office paid the
charges for this successful offering for three years. Over time the CCCPB
expanded this service to include librarians. The current funding for the
faculty modem pool ends on June 30, 1998.
   
…  Working closely together this past year, IST and the residential hall
computing staff designed and implemented a project to bring high-speed
network connections to all campus residential facilities. This project
means that by buying and installing Ethernet cards in their computers,
students in residence halls now have the option of connecting to the
campus network at speeds comparable to on-campus computing facilities - no
busy signals and no long waits for files of modest sizes to load. The
costs of this service, and basic cable TV, are included in the basic room
rate. Telephone services (basic and long distance) are billed directly to
each student.
   
…  Now that the tremendous effort associated with the new residential
networking service has been completed, IST staff members are implementing
a new streamlined, scalable recharge modem service that will be an
alternative to the overcrowded free service. This new option will be
available later in this calendar year and will cost approximately $10 per
month. It will be easy to sign up for, and pay for, this service. It is
based on software developed for the very successful faculty modem service.
The free dial-in service will be upgraded to replace obsolete modems. IST
will continue to operate the free modem pool for all students and staff
who are unwilling to participate in the recharge service. This new
scalable service is a much-improved version of the existing recharge
service, and it will be packaged and marketed in a much better manner.

The existing policy endorsed by the IT committee, and approved by the
CCCPB, states that network access from home is partially the
responsibility of every user. The University does not, and cannot, pay for
a student's personal computer, software and maintenance for that system,
its local modem, a home telephone line, phone usage charges, commuting
costs to campus, or parking fees at Berkeley. 

In the recent budget process, IST did not receive the funding needed to
equip, maintain, and operate the new student computing facility proposed
as a collaborative project with the Physics Department. The project was
awarded a 1996 Minor Cap Award, but we do not have the funds to complete
the project or staff it. We also have not been able to raise the funds
necessary to renovate the Davis computing facility requested by Computer
Science. There are millions of dollars of similar proposals waiting to be
funded to improve Berkeley's instructional technology environment. The
university's budgeting process has placed many of these needs, such as
improving the technology in classrooms, in a higher priority than
providing unlimited free modem service for students and staff.

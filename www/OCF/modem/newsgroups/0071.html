&gt; so the best solution to the sprintlink problem is this -- every student

&gt; pool just in case we need to access the campus network from the other
&gt; side??

No, I think that the best solution is for the university to get a better
internet connection.  However, just because I think that that should
happen, that doesn't mean that I know it will happen.  You claim to know
that it will happen, so I hope you will enlighten us about how you know
that, and when it will happen.  (It would be nice to know how much it
will cost, also.)

&gt; no -- i show a lack of concern for those who -- while moneyed enough to
&gt; buy a computer -- cannot shell out $15/month for dial-up access and demand
&gt; that the university provide it for free.

But your lack of concern extends to those who *are* willing to pay what
it costs, since you still want to deprive them of good dialup access to
campus machines.  (I'm curious, exactly how are you connecting, since
Sprintlink has been completely down between Autobahn and UCB for a good
three hours now?)

&gt; further, let's get real. we're not talking about despondent multitudes od
&gt; students wailing in grief

Speak for yourself, not for me.  I know who I am talking about.  I don't
need you to tell me who "we" are talking about.  You can talk about
students who abuse the system, if that's what turns you on.  I, however,
am talking about those who have a legitimate desire to access campus
computing resources for their classes.  I haven't taken many classes on
this campus since the web was invented, but I'm pretty surprised if a
large and growing number of classes, in all departments, don't have
class web pages and mailing lists with up-to-date class information, at
the least.  The only class I'm taking is not a technical class,
certainly not in CS or EECS, but it depends on a mailing list that
everyone needs to access.  You are free to argue that that is just a
"convenience", not a necessity, but it's disingenuous to put it in the
same category as playing games and downloading pornography.

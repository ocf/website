: I think that the University has plenty of money. Didn't I just read in the
: Daily Cal a few days ago that they increased salaries for lots of high
: level administrators ( I believe it was the Chancellor or the Regents or
: somebody...)?

campus chancellors got raises. regents are not paid, and below the
chancellors pay is set by campus (ie by the chancellors, if not directly).

it should be said, though, that as a rule ucb faculty/admins are
underpaid in relation to their ability and skill level -- not just in cns 
but across the board. faculty retention is a big problem, and i imagine
that when the regents went shopping for a new chancellor they were
somewhat limited by the pay they could offer. luckily, there was another
big public school out there (utexas) with it's own underpaid, highly
skilled president( ie chancellor) who had his hands tied by a
micormanaging state legislature and wanted some freedom.

but certainly one way for cns to attract and retain top people would be to
rethink it's mission and shed duties like dial-up access. i personally
would have no problem with a more "service-oriented" cns focused on
technical assistance and high-level connectivity concerns (sprintlink,
internal routers, an extranet, etc.). such a new mission would certainly
warrant some salary increases. why waste skilled people's time maintaining
modems? let bottom-feeding (or volume-dealing) isps do that. they're more
efficient at it anyway.

: (As long as we're talking about mismanagement of resources, I remember
: hearing somewhere that even during peak time there were 10 or so unused
: modems in the faculty pool. It would be easy, as aid to a temporary
: solution, to let students have access to those lines, and kick them off if
: needed by faculty. I'm sure people would be more than happy to do so.)

this is a tremendously good idea, if technically possible, in my opinion.

: their budget was also smaller. This university needs to either have more
: on-campus housing, or more on-campus computer facilities. Or, I don't
: know, let students hook up ethernet in their apartments.

what about more (more -- not total) centralization and consolidation of
the microcomputer facilities? there are six general facilities, plus about
four instructional facilities on top of that (some of which are
transparently on top of other facilties, ie using the same resources). of
those, most students know of perhaps two (usually moffitt and wheeler, two
very "impacted" labs). how many people go to DavisMF, for instance? how
busy is the tolman IMF? why not consolidate everything into two or three
MFs -- on north and south (and west) of campus? that way, people don't
have to wait excessiveky for a computer just because they picked (or
happened to know about) the wrong facility. this also reduced the chance
that any particular MF computer purchased by the university sits idle. and
at least on of the MFs should be open 24hrs, throughout the academic year.

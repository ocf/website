&gt; what about more (more -- not total) centralization and consolidation of
&gt; the microcomputer facilities? there are six general facilities, plus about
&gt; four instructional facilities on top of that (some of which are
&gt; transparently on top of other facilties, ie using the same resources). 

The only "transparent" one is Davis.  All the others are divided up
clearly.  Like HMF right next to WMF, Language down the hall from
Dwinelle etc.

&gt; of those, most students know of perhaps two (usually moffitt and
&gt; wheeler, two very "impacted" labs). how many people go to DavisMF,
&gt; for instance?

It was almost full on Friday morning when I was working there.  It has
screwy general access hours, with some days reserved for CS3, so not
that many people go up there.

&gt; how busy is the tolman IMF?

Tolman isn't busy, but it's very necessary.  That's the phone number
that we actually give out, and the back room is used by our technical
staff.  If you're thinking it should be opened to general access, it
won't work - Tolman would actually need substantial remodelling before
we could open it to general (non-instructional) access.

&gt; why not consolidate everything into two or three MFs -- on north and
&gt; south (and west) of campus? that way, people don't have to wait
&gt; excessiveky for a computer just because they picked (or happened to
&gt; know about) the wrong facility. 

Many disadvantages.  First, it's more convenient to have a small lab
right near where your next class is than a giant lab two buildings
over.  Second, there isn't that much of a problem of one lab is busy
while all the others are empty.  In general, it's faster to wait than
to walk to another lab that's got a free computer.  Third, there are
bottlenecks that limit the number of people who can get on a computer
at a single time, and they aren't related to not having enough
computers.  In Evans, the waitlist can't be handled as fast as people
leave computers at certain times.  If 20 people leave on the hour (ten
minutes before class starts), you can't fill those computers
immediately.  If you had a lab with 150 computers, it would be a
constant problem, rather than a few 5 minute busy periods during the
day.  It wouldn't make it any cheaper, either, unless you were going
to say that the lab attendents weren't supposed to help people with
computer problems anymore - you need one staff member for every X
people, not X staff members per lab.  This is why Moffitt has half the
computers of Tolman, but two people where Tolman has one - at Tolman,
we just tell people to ask their TAs.

&gt; this also reduced the chance that any particular MF computer
&gt; purchased by the university sits idle. and at least on of the MFs
&gt; should be open 24hrs, throughout the academic year. 

Sure, I'd like that too, but where are you going to find someone who's
willing to work at 4:00am?  I wouldn't want to.  Opening Moffitt 24
hours during finals causes a lot of problems.  The computers don't get
cleaned, they don't go through their daily maintainence cycle so they
get more errors, no one wants to work more than one of two late night
shifts a semester, and so on.

Most of these problems could be solved by just locking down the
computers and leaving the facilities unstaffed, but I doubt most of
our users would like that.

You can get more information at tuna2/facility or cafe/ on the web.

[note: Judging from my last pay stub, I am a mere peon at Workstation
and Microcomputer Facilities.  Anyone who was authorized to actually
speak for them or decide what their opinions are would make far more
money and have a more impressive title than I do.

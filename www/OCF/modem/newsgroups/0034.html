At one time, the policy at Berkeley was to move enough modems to the
Warhol pool to keep the Quality of Service fairly high, and only to put
those modems which were left over in longer-time service. The idea was to
let everyone check POP mail, with enough modem availability that users
would work off-line, and knowing that a modem would be available later,
reconnect to send queued messages. Newsreaders were to have been used in a
similar manner.

Just when did that plan softly die, and how did 2-hour downloads become
more important than reliable e-mail service?

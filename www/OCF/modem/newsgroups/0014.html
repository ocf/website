&gt; Of course, if they already -had- Netscape 4.x, they would already have
&gt; resume-download functionality (kind of).  It's not as good as FTP, but
&gt; it's better than nothing.  I'm sure someone desperate enough for it
&gt; could find a friend and transfer it with floppies. =)

Wait, I have netscape 4.03  And it dosen't seem like the resume-download
function is working.  When I get cut off, and tried to download it again (click
in the same place
again) it just replaces the old file.

True, but I don't really expect great access from anything government
sponsered.  The thing is, though, I don't need great access.  The best
solution right now would be to just start yanking the accounts of
anyone who is clearly violating the policy.  Does someone who had
their computer logged in for 168 straight have a right to complain
when they get their account yanked?  No.  The policy is quite clear
that the home-ip account is intended only to be used when someone is
using the computer.  The beginning of the solution is to start
enforcing the policy.

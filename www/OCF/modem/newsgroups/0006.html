&gt;Naah; the real problem is the student/modem ratio.

imiho, that's right. except that is should be
(student+faculty+staff)/modem ratio. hopefully, there will be
an announcement real soon that addresses this issue.

&gt;The problem is that UCB simply isn't allocating enough resources to
&gt;Internet access.  (Typical for UCB.)

hmm. (modems != internet access):

    + the campus routers (all upgraded in the past 12 months);
    + the campus backbones (expanded somewhat in the past 12 months);
    + switches/hubs on departmental LANs (lots in the past 12 months);
    + new connections to the campus network (about 300-400 per
      month -- not including the reshall connections);
    + connections for students in reshalls (about 4000 in the past 3
      months, on a new, reshall-only backbone -- this might be expected
      to reduce the modem contention, btw);
    + substantial improvements in connectivity to other uc campuses,
      stanford, esnet sites;
    - sprintlink; :-(
    + participation in calren2 planning and design (which will substantially
      improve internet access, if it actually happens);
    + staff to keep all that stuff working;

on the other hand, i would agree that UCB hasn't allocated adequate
resources to satisfy demand for dialin access. but like i said, i hope
there will be an announcement real soon that addresses this issue.

&gt;Until more resources get allocated, and the student/modem ratio is
&gt;fixed, any minor tweaks (such as a two-hour timie limit) will be nothing
&gt;more than ineffective cosmetic patches.

yup. though i'll note that someone who loses an hour's worth of work because
they didn't set the kitchen timer may have somewhat stronger words than
"ineffective" and "cosmetic." :-)

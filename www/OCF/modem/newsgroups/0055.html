No argument there.  I just wanted to point out my problem.
I no longer use school annex for net connection.  I've got a real ISP, an 
international one as a matter of fact.  Unfortunately, I HAD to log on to
EECS annex this week to work on project because of the lag between UCB and 
the elsewhere.  It certainly was not my ISP's fault as everything outside 
of UCB had no lag.  I think that money should go into routers/switches than 
to modems.  My guess is that it would be cheaper to maintain than 10000 
phone lines and would be more useful.

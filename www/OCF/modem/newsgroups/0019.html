&gt;Well, I already whined about this once on ucb.sysadmin, but what the
&gt;hell, why not flame again?  The 2 hour auto time-out is an ill-conceived
&gt;waste of time.  It makes HomeIP less convenient for users, while not
&gt;doing anything to really address the issue of the overloaded modem
&gt;bank.  If you're going to implement a rationing system, do a real
&gt;one, not a faux-rationing system that kills your session in the middle
&gt;of your work every two hours.

Speaking as a user, I find that the two-hour time limit has dramatically
improved my chances of getting online, especially during peak hours in the
late afternoon and evening.  Speaking as an administrator, the two-hour time
limit can be downright annoying.  However, I feel that the tradeoff of the 
convenience of getting online within ten minutes of when the harebrained
idea comes up in the first place (but only for two hours) is preferable to
not being able to get online at all.

Now before you jump onto my back and tell me that I don't know what I'm
talking about, it's less convenient, blah blah blah, is it any more
inconvenient than waiting for four hours to get online?  I think that a
per-week or a per-month rationing system would be more obnoxious than the
current two-hour time limit.  (Also, while we're at it, why don't you
suggest a better course of action instead of just nixing the idea?  I'm
sure that IS&amp;T would love to hear realistic solutions to what is now becoming
a huge issue on campus.)

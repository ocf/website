Dear community members:

The last couple of modem thread have been on the mark and reproduced much
of the discussion that we have had over the last two years in the
Instructional Technology Subcommittee of the CCCPB.  Please do not sell
your student representatives short.  They have fought with single-minded
determination to expand access.  In particular, the UG representatives
have massed large numbers attendees and e-mails.

Nevertheless, all of the special pleading in the world cannot change the
hard facts.  IS&amp;T has seen 20% cuts in the last two years and students
have been unwilling to adopt even $7 fees for bettering access.  As a
result, when UCB does get new funds, they are slated for investments that
more directly impact instruction.  For example, we only have 18
general-access classrooms with ethernet and projection equipment.  We
ought to have 200.  

Moreover, although free modem access was once a worthwhile endeavor
because there were no private ISP, at this point in time, the modem
annexes are little more than a poorly functioning entitlements.  Like it
or not, students receive a massive subsidy from the taxpayers.  UCB could
easily command over twice the current tuition.  With new revenue, the UC
system could pay for a host of exciting new initiatives.  Without it, we
limp along as best we can.  No one would think of asking the taxpayers to
foot your phone bill, so why should they pay for your data line?

As for the faculty modems, the grant came from the Chancellor's
discretionary funds.  It is questionable if the funds will be renewed when
they run out.  In either case, salaries at UCB are on average 24% under
comparable institutions.  In many departments such as the law and business
schools, salaries are 30-40% under market value.  As a result, recruitment
and retention have become major problems and these headaches will not cede
to a $14-a-month subsidy.

Be that as it may, the relevant questions are two:  how can we extend a
secure extranet and how can we best ration?  I believe that we are all in
agreement about the problems with domain-name look-up security.  We need
to provide password access, and the handshake has to be secure. The latter
is of particular importance because we are currently being slain by
hackers laying in sniffers. Unfortunately, secure shells do not come cheap
since every client has to have an app that can secure the tunnel.  To the
best of my knowledge, IS&amp;T is still at the fact-finding and pilot stage. 
In addition, UCOP is trying to come up with a system-wide solution to the
same problem.

As for the modems, the two-hour limit is a simple solution to a complex
problem.  There are better, more expensive solutions such as monitoring
total monthly time.  However, IS&amp;T has decided to put their limited
resources into a more robust and equitable fix.  The existing modem banks
will wither by the design of a two-year old order from the Chancellor.  In
their place will rise a better service.  IS&amp;T is ready to offer much
improved services at half the rate of a commercial ISP.  This plan was
just been approved by the Chancellor at today's CCCPB meeting.  I will
post--with consent--the announcement by Vice Chancellor McCredie.

In closing,  I am not in anyway associated with IS&amp;T.  Please refer any
questions that you might have to their official representatives.  As for
the IT Committee, I hope that I have not misrepresented our discussions,
but much distortion is inevitable when summarizing two-years worth of
thrashing amongst several dozen people.  I hope this helps remove some of
the cloudiness surrounding our discussion of access.  On to bigger and
better problems, like high-bandwidth access for all and
University-subsidized RAM for my ancient Mac and lobotomized PC. ;-)

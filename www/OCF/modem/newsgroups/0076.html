Amaen.
I for one sure hope it can stay around.
Since the stated purpose of this teporary server access was to test
the machine at full load, it seems that the testing that was proposed
for this machine cannot have been completed yet.
I have never found the line busy.
That means that very few people are aware of this phone number and
server.
If DCNS want to test it, more people need to know about it. 
Maybe I should not be saying this if I want to keep using this server?

Anyway, grateful for the line, Its very nice to search for references
and stuff from home and not need to be trying to borrow someone's
computer, or using the terrible lynx thing from campus. For me
computer access on campus is horrendous.

&gt;the whining over 2 hour modem time limits and suggestions of rationing or

&gt;it doesn't.

I didn't say it did, Ryan.  However, it *does* have a duty 
to administer the funds you and I are handing them in a reasonable
manner.  I don't think the policy they've implemented for modem use
qualifies.

That does leave the larger issue of whether it's a reasonable and
responsible use of the monies we're giving them to run a modem
bank at all.  I'll conceed that that is a more debateable point.
However, I'd ask you to consider these points: 1. as has already
been pointed out, resources that students need to access for their
work are not necessarily accessible if you're using a commercial
ISP; and 2. If the University (and system-wide) wishes to continue
in a policy of encouraging/requiring the use of electronic resources
for coursework, while simultaneously A. not spending sufficient funds
for student access to computing resources and B. not making student ownership
of computers a legal requirement of attendance, then they are
effectively implementing another fee on students, and one 
which students *cannot* use financial aid resources to acquire.
One you count up the costs, not only of ISP services, but computer
hardware and software that students must acquire, I'll think you
agree that comes to a pretty hefty additional fee we're being asked
to pay.

Maybe we should pay.  But I'd feel a lot better about it if: 1. IS&amp;T
and the campus made more efforts to consult with students about
overall campus technology policy directions instead of implementing
things by fiat (the student reps. to the CCCPB are a good start, 
but not adequate in themselves), and 2. the campus engaged in a policy
of making financial aid for computer ownership available *before*
they make attendance at the University difficult or impossible to
perform without one.

&gt;Where did you get this notion?  What people are usually complaining
&gt;about is that sprintlink drops their packets---that's generally what
&gt;makes a connection "slow".  When I say that sprintlink drops my packets,
&gt;what I mean is that sprintlink drops my packets.

Well, with all due respect to the fact that I may be agreeing with you
by the end of this note, I wasn't referring to anything you were
saying, but to Alan Coopersmith's discussion with the person I was
responding to:

Alan wrote that ryan travis tate wrote:

&gt;&gt;and while is&amp;t may be able to offer internet access for half the
&gt;&gt;price of
&gt;&gt;a typical isp, i have little confidence it will will offer anywhere
&gt;&gt;near
&gt;&gt;the same quality of service.
&gt;
&gt;For people connecting to *.berkeley.edu hosts, it can provide much
&gt;better service than any ISP that has to fight through SprintLink to
&gt;get
&gt;to hosts on campus.

I think that the problem that Alan is referring to is pretty clearly a
differential in access times to berkeley.edu hosts depending on
whether the host has to route through sprintlink or not. Whether
that's a problem of routing or of droping packets is debatable, no
doubt, but if it takes 190ms to reach an earthlink host and 60ms to
reach a sprintlink one, I suspect that this is going to result in a
lot more "slowness" (under most definitions) than any problems with
dropped packets.

Again, I still think that sprintlink is inferior service; I just think
that fighting through routing, which occurs all the time, is more
likely to cause a notable service difference than the problem of
dropped packets, which, IMHO, is intermittent and relatively rare.

&gt;&gt; Standard disclaimers apply: one would need a much more complex
&gt;&gt; model. From the perspective of someone who switches between campus and
&gt;&gt; off-campus providers fairly often, and who rarely notices that much of
&gt;&gt; a difference, I don't think the issue is that significant in relation
&gt;&gt; to the other ones here.
&gt;
&gt;You frequently log in to your off-campus provider, telnet to a campus
&gt;machine, and run text editors and the like, without noticing any
&gt;significant lag or difference between that and a direct connection?  I
&gt;find this hard to believe.
&gt;

I can see how, for a text session sending one-char-per-packet, there
might be a significant difference between a telephone modem connection
depending on whether it originated on or off campus. What significance
slower response times would have for a much larger series of
applications, from straight data transfers to streaming audio, is yet
again a different question -- though I'd suggest that using a TCP
utility to tweak one's waits/waters/timeouts would do much to improve
this...

Now, as a caveat, I'll admit that I've been pinging hosts from my
office mac and from socrates while this was going on, and the
statistics aren't pretty and would suggest degradation of any network
transmission:

HOST:			%loss from	%loss from
			socrates	dwinelle

husc.harvard.edu	12		19
blood.bbnplanet.com	21		16
colrain.williams.edu	18		18

though these are (intentionally) all east coast bnnplanet hosts. Note
that colrain is out on a leg through amherst that (I believe) isn't
quite t-1 get, and gets rerouted from their science center over to
their computer center, and has various other transmission
difficulties; husc is of course on bbnplanet's boston hub (being an
original near-net site), and blood, I believe, is still sitting on a
6th/7th floor subnet of bbn's cambridge park office, which means it
should be even better connected than husc. These are ridiculous losses
to those hosts, and if they can be shown to be more common than I
claim above I will be eating my words soon :)

&gt;Sprintlink and BBN Planet are
&gt;just bad.  I just hope they are cheap.
&gt;

I'm not sure why you include BBN Planet in that list; generally I
considered them absolutely reliable; while there certainly was some
grumbling (inside planet) about the overall competence of former
BARRNet acquired personel, and which may have related to the
frustration's that berkeley had with the lack of bnn's responsiveness
to berkeley's concerns, I don't think any of those issues had much to
do with connectivity issues... and certainly planet's committment to
24/7 service, whatever it takes, is quite a direct contrast to the
buffoonery of sprintlink personel. (To be more specific, if williams
were experience the kind of packet loss that I showed above, it would
be upgraded to a serious problem quite quickly if it were not
resolved, while sprintlink seems to be taking it in stride.)

&gt;&gt; So you think it is the university's business to judge what I should
&gt;&gt; read while using university resources?
&gt;
&gt;Certainly it would be better if the university could do so easily.  I
&gt;don't think many people object to that concept.

For now, I won't even touch this one :) ...

Yours,

Ken



&gt;  For example, there's a
&gt;big sign in a computer room I use that says no game playing during
&gt;certain hours, or when people are waiting to use the machines.  I never
&gt;heard anyone assert that it was none of the university's business if
&gt;they wanted to tie up the machines playing games.

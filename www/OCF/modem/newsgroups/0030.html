<pre>
someone suggested 60 hours/week. i think that may seem too much. so how
about 45 hours/week? i think most of us can make adjustments if we
really want to download/upload big files and other stuff.

however, that will only solve the problem in the short run. in the long
run, i think the university should increase the number of modems in the
pool and ALSO upgrade the connection speed. is the university really
short of fund in doing those two things?

&gt;&gt;This university needs to either have more on-campus housing,
&gt;&gt;or more on-campus computer facilities.
&gt;
&gt;I realize most students memories don't go as far back as mine, but
&gt;things have improved greatly in both these areas since I first came
&gt;in 1990.  Back then, before Foothill opened, no one was guaranteed a
&gt;dorm room - as an incoming freshman I almost didn't get one because
&gt;my lottery number was above 3,000.  And the only Mac/PC facilities
&gt;on campus at the time were:
&gt;        - Tolman, which was reserved for class use only
&gt;        - Moffitt &amp; Eshleman, which charged by the hour for use
&gt;        - Unit 3, which was open to Unit 3 residents only
&gt;
&gt;Progress has been made, but it takes time given the huge size of the
&gt;University beuraucracy.  [I know, after all these years at Cal I should
&gt;have learned to spell that word long ago, but it always comes out
&gt;looking wrong.]

The thing is, the university is touting the 4-5,000 ethernet hookups they
have in the dorms as "proof" that they've dealt with the problem. I know,
it is progress, but they seem to use a partially helpful solution as
evidence of a solution. (Darn, PR...) I figure as long as they're touting
it as a solution, why not make it one? (They'd have to make living in the
dorms more palatable first for me, but that's a completely different
thread...)

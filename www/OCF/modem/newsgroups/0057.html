&gt;&gt; I don't understand this remark.
&gt; 
&gt; Such a packet filter could be trivially circumvented by using a proxy
&gt; server on a berkeley.edu machine (such as the established transend.CS
&gt; proxies, or a proxy set up on any of the thousands of *.berkeley.edu
&gt; machines outside the control of IS&amp;T, such as those in the dorms, those
&gt; run by various departments or student groups, etc.).

Now I understand what you are saying.  You aren't saying that it's
technically difficult to restrict access, you are saying that you think
there would be widespread abuse of means to circumvent that limitation.
I don't know if that's true or not.  I tend to doubt it---especially
since it wouldn't be that hard to detect---but it's probably a moot
point, since I doubt such limitations are in the cards.

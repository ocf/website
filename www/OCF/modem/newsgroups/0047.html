I've been fooling around with Cisco remote access server and am generally
pleased with the performance (and the ability to connect at will. :-)

Problems I have noted:

-Doesn't seem to handle secure connections well in Netscape: Everytime I've
tried to use secure connections in Navigator (4.03 for Mac) it seized up.
All data flow stopped, including in other programs that may have been using
the PPP connection in the background (Eudora, Fetch)

-A similar problem occurs when I try to upload html files to our web
server. My files are in Nisuswriter format, which normally transfers just
fine. However, when logged on from the Cisco RAS and using Fetch 3.03 to
transfer files, the connection will seize up halfway through the last (and
only the last) file. Attempts to disconnect freeze my computer. This
doesn't happen if I log in through the Annexen or send normal Simpletext
format files.

Anybody else see anything like that?

My setup:
Powerbook 5300cs, MacOS 7.6.1, FreePPP 2.5v3, Global Village Powerport Gold
PC Card modem, Fetch 3.03, Netscape Navigator (standalone) 4.03.

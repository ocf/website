&gt;Here's my proposal - maximum of 60 hours per week.  If you go over,
&gt;your home-ip account is yanked for a month.  Has no effect on small
&gt;users, and could be implimented fairly easily compared to a system
&gt;that actually kicked you off after a certain amount of time.

This sounds pretty reasonable to me.  The actual number of hours
per week would be something that you'd have to examine CNS's usage
statistics to set (allowing users 8.5 hours a day seems a bit
high, but I could be wrong).  And there might have to be some
tweaking of the hours allowed as people adjust to the system.
But I'd definitely take your proposal over the 2-hour limit.

&gt;The point is, though, that the 2 hour limit is equally unfair to
&gt;everyone.  Besides, grad students can probably, on average, better
&gt;afford an ISP, and there is no reason to believe that undergraduates
&gt;need less access to computers than grad students.

No argument on the issue that undergrads need as much access as grads,
however, that has never stopped the university from screwing the
undergrad population before.  I only said it was an option, not
a *good* option.  And believe me, the statement that "grad students
can probably, on average, better afford an ISP" would provoke only
cynical and bitter laughter from most of the grad students in my program. :)
As for the 2 hour limit being equally unfair to everyone, that's debatable.
Yes, it affects everyone.  But the amount of time on-line that any
one student ends up getting will be a matter of random chance based
on the 'who dials in to the modem bank at the right time' lottery.
Is it equally unfair that student X gets 80 hours on while student Y
gets 2, just because of the way the dial-in lottery fell out?  Maybe,
but I'd say the system you've proposed is quite a bit more fair, and
as you point out, should present no larger implementation problem for
IS&amp;T.

&gt;I would much prefer the worst service that can be provided free than
&gt;any sort of commercial service run by the university.  I very much
&gt;doubt that the University could provide decent service at a decent
&gt;price, so if you want to pay, go with an ISP.  Consider the last
&gt;proposed plan $100/year, with limited connect time during peak hours.
&gt;How does this compare to an ISP?  Pretty pathetic.  Putting a few on
&gt;it would just make the dial up lines a total waste.

Agreed.  IS&amp;T would make a lousy ISP.  However, you must admit that
if they started charging for the level of service they're providing,
users would abandon the modem pool in droves, making it easier to
dial-in.

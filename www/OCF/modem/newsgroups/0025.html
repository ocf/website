&gt; Does anyone have any idea what has been happening with homeIP via the
&gt; faculty annex for the last two nights (9/22 and 9/23)?  On Monday evening,
&gt; the stream slowed down enough to trigger a timeout on Eudora.
&gt; 
&gt; The problem became most sever last night between the hours of 11:00 PM and
&gt; 1:00 AM. It took me 1 hour and 12 minutes to download 50 e-mail messages!
&gt; None of them had attachments or were any longer than a screen.  Moreover,
&gt; today I have found out that mail sent last evening never reached our POP.
&gt; 
&gt; I also checked the stream rate with other applications.  Netscape
&gt; throughput--irrespective of site--was 100-200 bytes/sec.  Ftp to Haas was
&gt; no faster.

Hmm, it's hard to say where the slowdown is.  If it's on the HIP subnet,
I'd expect lots of people (not just on the faculty annex) would see it.

Where are the sites you were connecting to?  You mentioned ftp to haas;
is your POP server there also?  Were the slow web sites all on campus?

Some things to try if this happens again:  Try using 'ping' to look for
packet losses.  If your home machine doesn't have ping, then login to
your
campus account (assuming you have a shell account) and ping your home
machine from there.  You can also try ftp'ing some files from various
sites to compare the throughput.  (Stick to campus sites; if you go
off-campus we get into complications with Sprintlink performance).

For everyone else:  Have you noticed similar slowdowns on the other
annexes?

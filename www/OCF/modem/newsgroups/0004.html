   So how is someone with a 14.4 connection (since that's all you offer)
   supposed to download a large file, say Netscape 4.0 that is something like
   10 MB in size, if you cut people off after 2 hours?

The quick answer is, use sneaker net from a campus machine. :-)

The slightly more annoying answer is: get a faster modem, and
find somewhere to dial in with it. :-)

The most annoying answer is, get an ISP account, see
<a href="http://tuna2.berkeley.edu/email.html#INT">http://tuna2.berkeley.edu/email.html#INT</a>

The problem here is that the campus has limited resources, and almost
unlimited need for modem connections.  Why would anyone want to use
some krufty ISP when they can struggle to dial in to UCB for free :-)

To me, the larger problem is that anyone with any savy can keep a modem
link up forever, and have it redial when necessary.  Thus, we get 2
hour limits.

Unfortunately, any plan to engineer social behaviour via time limits
etc. is always flawed and unfair to someone.

Before anyone flames me back, consider how you would deal with the
situation if you had to manage the campus modem banks.

I don't like the idea of 2 hour limits, but I can't think of a better
solution.  Going back to the monthly quota system has overhead issues,
and configuring the modem bank to implement monthly quotas would be
tricky.

If anyone has a better solution, let's hear it.

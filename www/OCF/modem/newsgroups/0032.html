certainly not everyone who complains about the modem situation is whining
but many are, in my purely subjective opinion.

as far as campus-only internet resources -- cobweb, encyclopedias,
site-licensed stuff -- i agree that the university needs to devise a
system to access these resources from outside the campus network. in
fact, i raised just that point in a series of posts about two years ago,
when campus administrators started saying openly that isp's were the
preferred mode of access for ucb students. i don't know if any
comprehensive study has been done to look into that problem.

here's a suggestion: restricted internet resources could be made available
over the web via encrypted connections (ssl) and a login system that uses
one's home-ip username and password (aka network id and network passwd).
the encryption would not be impentrable (most people have export-strength
only browsers) but probably sufficient for the companies we site-license
from.

*or* the dial-in modems could be restricted to _just_ special resources
like cobweb/cornucopia/tuna/tele-bears/bearfacts et. al. only certain
subdomains of berkeley.edu would be accessible.

what's most important, in my view, is that campus officials level with
students on the viability of continued free dial-up access and direct
their thinking and resources toward a transition to isps. pulling the plug
now would be a powerful impetus and would free up money for the
transition.

as far as faculty modems, my understanding is that they were bought with
money from the chancellor's discretionary fund. the chancellor's office
could shut down the modems and instead give faculty members a monthly
credit sufficient to cover the costs of a solid isp. (given the low level
of use of the faculty moderms, there are probably substantial savings to
be had here.)

as far as the question of whether to move further into the realm of
intergrating internet use into the uc curriculumn and thus nearly
requiring students to buy computers/modems -- this can be ratched up until
computers get cheaper. beefing up campus computer labs would justify some
integration of the internet.

&gt;The 33.6s would be better used on the general dialup lines, even if
&gt;there isn't enough money to replace all of them.

In another thread concerning the 2-hour limit, there was disussion of time
limits based on the connection speed; those who could only make a slower
connection would get more time.

Putting the fastest modems into 15-minute service is consistent with that
idea, for what it's worth. It may also be good human factors to reward the
parsimonious user with some extra convenience.

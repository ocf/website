&gt;departments. the last thing we need is to throw _more_ money at cs/eecs.)

The CS/EECS depts. have their own modem banks (which is why, as I noted
earlier, I never use the IS&amp;T modems and I never have problems getting
a 28.8k modem line into campus, with redials being rare).

And while many (but not all, and fewer each year) humanities majors can
get away without modems to do their homework, ask any of the ones using
the Micro Facilities if they'd like the already long lines there to grow
much larger because the campus killed free modems and students, being
cheap, now have to go to the MF's to use their free e-mail accounts &amp;
surf the web.  Besides, *I* don't need most of the millions of books in
the campus libraries to do *my* homework -- why should I pay for *your*
books?

And yes, technically, no one *needs* a modem to do homework, but many
people need computers to do homework, and it's cheaper/more efficient 
for the University to stick a modem in the basement of Evans than to
buy/maintain a computer and then find space for another micro facility
and hire more students to watch them.  Unfortunately, until the time
computers are grouped in with books,etc. as required materials and
covered by financial aid, the University has to provide computer labs
for students who can't afford their own.
 
&gt;and while is&amp;t may be able to offer internet access for half the price of
&gt;a typical isp, i have little confidence it will will offer anywhere near
&gt;the same quality of service.

For people connecting to *.berkeley.edu hosts, it can provide much
better service than any ISP that has to fight through SprintLink to get
to hosts on campus.  (Granted, SprintLink has gotten much better than it
was last year when we first switched, but still...)

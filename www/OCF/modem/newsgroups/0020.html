&gt;However, I feel that the tradeoff of the

&gt;not being able to get online at all.
&gt;

If the tradeoff worked, I'd probably be for it.  But my experience has
not, unfortunately, matched yours.  I had the auto-dialer running 40
minutes last night before I logged in.  I haven't noticed any difference
in the amount of time it takes to login since the auto-logout was
established.

This is not horribly surprising.  To paraphrase one of the faculty
in our school, when demand for an information service outstrips the
supply, you have two basic choices: 1. raise the price to reduce the demand,
or 2. implement a rationing system.  CNS *attempted* to implement
a rationing system.  They failed to do so, as there is no limit
on the total amount of time any one user can login.  Users therefore
have no reason to restrict their use, and the demand for the resource
is continuing unabated.  There's nothing about CNS' new policy that
guarantees an equitable distribution of resources to students, nor
does it address the underlying issue of demand outstripping supply.

&gt;(Also, while we're at it, why don't you
&gt;suggest a better course of action instead of just nixing the idea?  I'm
&gt;sure that IS&amp;T would love to hear realistic solutions to what is now becoming
&gt;a huge issue on campus.)
&gt;

I already did on another newsgroup which I assume CNS is monitoring, but
here it is if you're interested.  While you expressed a distaste for 
an hours-per-week, or hours-per-month or hours-per-semester rationing system, 
that is, ultimately, a better solution than a 2-hour cutoff.  It will actually
do something about bringing the demand and supply of resources on
campus into alignment, which the current cutoff policy does not.
Enforcing a limit on the total number of hours any student can use the
modem bank will free the modems up far quicker than any cutoff policy
IS&amp;T could implement, as it will force students to consider their usage
and how to optimize it.  The current policy doesn't.  And to answer
your question, no, I don't think an enforced limit on the number of hours
I can connect will be particularly convenient for me, but I think it
will be more convenient than the 2-hour cutoff, and provide for a more
equitable distribution of resources to students and staff on campus
than this new policy.

There are other solutions IS&amp;T could contemplate, but I doubt they'll
make me very many friends either.  Another way CNS could restrict
demand for their resources is to pull out the academic rank issue
and deny use of the modem bank to undergraduates, period.  Reducing
the size of the user pool by 20,000 individuals would free up the
modem bank in a hurry, and since I'm a graduate student, I'd find
that policy very convenient indeed. :)  But I'm sure that all of the
undergrads forced to start paying for ISP time would think otherwise.

CNS could also return to the previous system where you're allowed to
stay logged in while you're active.  I'll admit that isn't a solution
either, but it's no less of one than the current policy, and if CNS
can't supply the demand, they should at least ensure that what they're
supplying is the most useful service possible.  My understanding is that one
of the major reasons they didn't like that alternative was that
many people have found mechanisms to defeat the inactivity auto-logoff
and were getting real close to staying connected 24x7.  I would 
point out that their new policy *won't* necessarily stop that behavior.
I've already figured out one technological means some people could use
to circumvent their system, and I'm sure you can as well.  An upper limit of
hours that people can connect per semester *will* solve that problem.
People won't stay connected 24x7 if they know that it will result
in their losing all network access by the 3rd week of the semester.

Alternatively, CNS could go with the "raise the price" solution rather than
the "manage demand" solution: go into the ISP business themselves and
start charging students for their time online.  While both the ASUC
and the GA were against the 'technology fee' that U.C. systemwide wanted
to implement, I think students would be much more willing to consider
a for-pay service if they knew where their money was going.
Historically, though, IS&amp;T has been reluctant to become a revenue-generating 
entity, and they have good reasons for that, but it is one possibility.

I appreciate CNS' dilemma; there isn't a good solution to the problem
they face (failing Pete Wilson suddenly throwing $90 million in Jack
McCredie's direction).  But there are more effective, more equitable solutions
to the problem of the impacted modem bank than what they're proposing.

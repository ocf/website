&gt;however, that will only solve the problem in the short run. in the long

&gt;short of fund in doing those two things?

Yes.  IS&amp;T can't even afford to pay salaries to their own employees
competitive with the surrounding industry.  If it's any consolation,
it's not unique to Berkeley.  The Chronicle of Higher Education did
an article recently about the problems all universities are experiencing
in providing computing/network infrastructures to students, and
retaining experienced IT personnel in the face of the high demand
for such in industry.  The capital costs for extending computing facilities
for students are high (as are maintenance costs), and these costs
are hitting universities at almost the exact same time that federal
and state funds are drying up.  A nasty situation that does not,
unfortunately, show any signs of abetting soon.

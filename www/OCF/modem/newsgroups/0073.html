&gt; I realize most students memories don't go as far back as mine, but
&gt; things have improved greatly in both these areas since I first came
&gt; in 1990.  Back then, before Foothill opened, no one was guaranteed a
&gt; dorm room - as an incoming freshman I almost didn't get one because
&gt; my lottery number was above 3,000.  And the only Mac/PC facilities 
&gt; on campus at the time were:
&gt; 	- Tolman, which was reserved for class use only
&gt; 	- Moffitt &amp; Eshleman, which charged by the hour for use
&gt; 	- Unit 3, which was open to Unit 3 residents only

Seconded.  Except that my memory goes back to 1987, when *I* was
a freshman.  Back then, the only "computer room" in the dorms/ResHalls
was a terminal room in CKC, which had a bunch of dumb terminals.  Other
than that, you used your own modem or you walked over to campus.

&gt; &gt;Or, I don't know, let students hook up ethernet in their apartments.

&gt; That's easy - figuring out how to connect them to campus is hard - and
&gt; MUCH more expensive than normal modems since you're generally looking
&gt; at ISDN or something faster/more expensive.

A concept that would have been almost unthinkable when I was a freshman.
I well remember falling back to 1200 or even 300 bps modems when the
2400 bps dialups filled up.  3-9600 was a godsend when it was 
instituted (with 32? modems), and I remember the first, fledgling 
days of Home IP.  I understand some of the ResHalls now have Ethernet 
hookups that multiplex an ISDN line to campus?  When I was a dorm 
dweller, my roommates and I had to compete for access to our room's 
one phone line (I once called Telecomm to find out how much a second 
line would cost...the answer was in the three-digit range, so I gave up).

What's the point?  Same as Alan's...progress gets made, even if it's
not as fast as some people would like.  (I know this isn't going to
get people connected, but maybe a bit of perspective could be
helpful.  After nine and a half years, you kind of learn to take a
long-term view.)

But even if the University miraculously gave students enough bandwidth
for cheap (free ISDN for all?), I bet that in ten years, or even
five, there are going to be very similar arguments all over again.  Maybe 
about whether the University should allow free use of subspace waveguides
inside the local gravitational well or something.  :-)

Peace,

Bruce.

PS.  In case anyone's wondering, I did both undergrad and grad school
at UCB...I did *not* take 9.5 years for one degree!

: For people connecting to *.berkeley.edu hosts, it can provide much
: better service than any ISP that has to fight through SprintLink to get
: to hosts on campus.  (Granted, SprintLink has gotten much better than it
: was last year when we first switched, but still...)

dialing in to campus modems is not a viable solution to the sprintlink
problem: you can't get _outside_ berkeley in that case, and, as was stated
previously in this thread, non-berkeley.edu domains are used frequently as
part of classwork.

so if you're with an outside isp you may be fighting to get in, but with
cns you're fighting to get out. either way sprintlink is a headache.

restricting modems to the berkeley.edu domain is a good idea in the sense
that it would allow easy occaisional access to restricted resources
(cobweb, site licensed stuff) for those with isp accounts (which would be
everyone) until the university can develop a secure extranet.

&gt; here it is if you're interested.  While you expressed a distaste for

&gt; that is, ultimately, a better solution than a 2-hour cutoff.  It will actually
&gt; do something about bringing the demand and supply of resources on
&gt; campus into alignment, which the current cutoff policy does not.
&gt; Enforcing a limit on the total number of hours any student can use the

&gt; IS&amp;T could implement, as it will force students to consider their usage
&gt; and how to optimize it.  The current policy doesn't.  And to answer

Here's my proposal - maximum of 60 hours per week.  If you go over,
your home-ip account is yanked for a month.  Has no effect on small
users, and could be implimented fairly easily compared to a system
that actually kicked you off after a certain amount of time.  I
remember than the logistics of it was why they didn't want to do a
time limit (per week I mean), but it should be trivial to
automatically shut off the accounts of those who have used a certain
amount of time in the previous week.  Set the number above what anyone
would reasonably use in a week, and you get rid of those who try to
keep their machines online 24/7.  (This is my main complaint - the
home-ip policy clearly states that you are only supposed to use the
account when you are using the computer, but it seems that DCNS
refuses to enforce this policy.)

&gt; and deny use of the modem bank to undergraduates, period.  Reducing

The point is, though, that the 2 hour limit is equally unfair to
everyone.  Besides, grad students can probably, on average, better
afford an ISP, and there is no reason to believe that undergraduates
need less access to computers than grad students.

&gt; supplying is the most useful service possible.  My understanding is that one
&gt; of the major reasons they didn't like that alternative was that
&gt; many people have found mechanisms to defeat the inactivity auto-logoff
&gt; and were getting real close to staying connected 24x7.  I would 

Guess what - that what happens now.  And people were on 24/7.

&gt; Alternatively, CNS could go with the "raise the price" solution rather than
&gt; the "manage demand" solution: go into the ISP business themselves and
&gt; start charging students for their time online.  While both the ASUC
&gt; and the GA were against the 'technology fee' that U.C. systemwide wanted
&gt; to implement, I think students would be much more willing to consider
&gt; a for-pay service if they knew where their money was going.

I would much prefer the worst service that can be provided free than
any sort of commercial service run by the university.  I very much
doubt that the University could provide decent service at a decent
price, so if you want to pay, go with an ISP.  Consider the last
proposed plan $100/year, with limited connect time during peak hours.
How does this compare to an ISP?  Pretty pathetic.  Putting a few on
it would just make the dial up lines a total waste.

&gt; "The sprintlink problem" being mentioned, it seems, is not that
&gt; sprintlink is generally slow, but that packets routed to other bay
&gt; area ISPs (allegedly) often follow unnecessarily circuitous routes --

Where did you get this notion?  What people are usually complaining
about is that sprintlink drops their packets---that's generally what
makes a connection "slow".  When I say that sprintlink drops my packets,
what I mean is that sprintlink drops my packets.

It's _also_ true that they seem to route my packets through some damn
strange places, to get to an ISP located a few blocks or miles away.  Of
course that's not a problem unique to sprint.  I wouldn't care so much
about that if they didn't drop the packets so often.

&gt; Standard disclaimers apply: one would need a much more complex
&gt; model. From the perspective of someone who switches between campus and
&gt; off-campus providers fairly often, and who rarely notices that much of
&gt; a difference, I don't think the issue is that significant in relation
&gt; to the other ones here.

You frequently log in to your off-campus provider, telnet to a campus
machine, and run text editors and the like, without noticing any
significant lag or difference between that and a direct connection?  I
find this hard to believe.

&gt; Agreed that sprintlink can be a headache and that we should still
&gt; probably drop them. Nevertheless, try some pings from sprintlink and
&gt; some local ISPs, or receiving video content and looking at the
&gt; statistics, and sprintlink is generally not that bad.

Been there, done that, disagree totally.  Sprintlink and BBN Planet are
just bad.  I just hope they are cheap.

&gt; So you think it is the university's business to judge what I should
&gt; read while using university resources?

Certainly it would be better if the university could do so easily.  I
don't think many people object to that concept.  For example, there's a
big sign in a computer room I use that says no game playing during
certain hours, or when people are waiting to use the machines.  I never
heard anyone assert that it was none of the university's business if
they wanted to tie up the machines playing games.

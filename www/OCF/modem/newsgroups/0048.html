&gt;departments get far more private donations and grants than humanities
&gt;departments. the last thing we need is to throw _more_ money at cs/eecs.)

	The EECS department supplies its own dialin lines for use by
the students, and I would think that most of the load on the general
lines is not used for connecting/working on EECS departmental
computers.  (And I suspect that a fair amount of the load on the EECS
modems is not from people using EECS machines.  Hey, EECS students
waste time on the web, too.  :)

It is a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, .signifying nothing.

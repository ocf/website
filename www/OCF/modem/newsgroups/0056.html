By "everything", you probably mean "everything not on Sprintlink"?  Did
you investigate the location of the congestion (with traceroute, etc.)?

&gt; I think that money should go into routers/switches than to modems.

The Berkeley network seems fine, I don't think there is a crying need
for faster routers or switches, although of course they do have to be
constantly upgraded.  No matter how much Berkeley spends on its routers,
that won't help you if Sprintlink is dropping packets, or routing them
through Timbuktu.

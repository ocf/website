&gt;days of Home IP.  I understand some of the ResHalls now have Ethernet 
&gt;hookups that multiplex an ISDN line to campus?  When I was a dorm 
&gt;dweller, my roommates and I had to compete for access to our room's 
&gt;one phone line (I once called Telecomm to find out how much a second 
&gt;line would cost...the answer was in the three-digit range, so I gave up).

I believe that most dorms now have 100-Mb connections.  (The one exception
is Clark Kerr, but I hear that problem is going to be alleviated soon.)

&gt;But even if the University miraculously gave students enough bandwidth
&gt;for cheap (free ISDN for all?), I bet that in ten years, or even
&gt;five, there are going to be very similar arguments all over again.  Maybe 
&gt;about whether the University should allow free use of subspace waveguides
&gt;inside the local gravitational well or something.  :-)

Pipe dreams, Bruce, pipe dreams. =)  I agree, though; UCB has made some
progress.  The upgrade of the routers recently has really helped overall
connectivity - unfortunately, UCB doesn't have the money to do everything 
we would like, like upgrading the computers in the MFs, improving dialups
and the people to staff them... (that and the bloody space problem)

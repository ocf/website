Hi Jack,

The other University I mentioned is the University of Oregon, which has
tried almost exactly what we are doing.  I should have just said so in
my original note.

I have also had pretty extensive discussions with people from most
(if not all) of the other UCs and several other Universities (we're
all hammered from time to time on this issue).  Time limits seem to
be pretty much universal, although the length varies from place to place.
I'd say that one hour is probably closer to a "standard" than 2.  Our
average hold time has been 43 minutes.  It'll be interesting to see how
that changes.

Where we differ the most from other places is in not offering a cheap,
shared, recharge service on campus modems.  We have tried to get ISPs
to take this on, with mixed results.  Come January, we will offer this
one way or another.

	Thanks,
		Cliff

&gt;&gt;	B)  There is no evidence that this will actually help more people
&gt;&gt;	    access the modem supply, so the result will be inconveniencing
&gt;&gt;	    people and not helping anything.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;    This is debatable.  There is evidence from at least one other University
&gt;&gt;    that it does, indeed, help.

&gt;Cliff,
&gt;
&gt;Is this other university UCLA?  I have only been here a few months but I

&gt;Personally, I believe they misspent the technology grant on wiring 
&gt;classrooms. Why? How often are you in a particular classroom versus 
&gt;how often are you at home?  Actual class time is limited and only to 
&gt;the wishes of the Professor in the class.

On the other hand, how many people use that single connection at home
versus in the classrooms?  The classroom wiring project is there to
bring audio/video/internet into the classroom so instructors can have
more tools at their disposal for teaching.  One of the commonly cited
goals is to be able to link classrooms at different campuses together
so students at Berkeley can learn from professors at other UC campuses
and the other campuses can learn from our professors, especially in this
day of consolidating departments and shrinking faculty sizes.

While I agree it may not have been the best use of funds, I don't think
the money was wasted by any means.  (But then, I'm a student in the CS
department where all the classrooms are already wired and professors use
the computers as part of their lectures all the time, as if it was as
natural as using the chalkboard, and I work for a group that has been
broadcasting seminars across the internet for several years now.)

&gt;This university needs to either have more on-campus housing, 
&gt;or more on-campus computer facilities. 

I realize most students memories don't go as far back as mine, but
things have improved greatly in both these areas since I first came
in 1990.  Back then, before Foothill opened, no one was guaranteed a
dorm room - as an incoming freshman I almost didn't get one because
my lottery number was above 3,000.  And the only Mac/PC facilities 
on campus at the time were:
	- Tolman, which was reserved for class use only
	- Moffitt &amp; Eshleman, which charged by the hour for use
	- Unit 3, which was open to Unit 3 residents only

Progress has been made, but it takes time given the huge size of the
University beuraucracy.  [I know, after all these years at Cal I should
have learned to spell that word long ago, but it always comes out
looking wrong.]

&gt;Or, I don't know, let students hook up ethernet in their apartments.

That's easy - figuring out how to connect them to campus is hard - and
MUCH more expensive than normal modems since you're generally looking
at ISDN or something faster/more expensive.

I've thought for a while the ideal solution would be to yell at TCI
until they expand their @Home cable modem service up to this end of the
Bay Area (currently it's only available down in Fremont &amp; Sunnyvale I
believe), and then arrange for a special tie in between @Home &amp; the
campus network, similar to Metricom's, bypassing SprintLink.  Perhaps if
the University offered to subsidize some of the costs of setting it up
or guaranteed a minimum number of subscribers or something...   (If it
was offered to staff as well as students the University could easily
justify picking up part of the bills for people who would use it to 
"telecommute".)

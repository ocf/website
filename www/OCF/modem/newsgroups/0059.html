&gt;dialing in to campus modems is not a viable solution to the sprintlink
&gt;problem: 

"The sprintlink problem" being mentioned, it seems, is not that
sprintlink is generally slow, but that packets routed to other bay
area ISPs (allegedly) often follow unnecessarily circuitous routes --
I remember someone posting traceroutes to stanford going through
bbnplanet's east coast link to sprintlink, though that was fixed
fairly quickly --

&gt;you can't get _outside_ berkeley in that case, and, as was stated
&gt;previously in this thread, non-berkeley.edu domains are used frequently as
&gt;part of classwork.

Reciprocally, then, this problem would only occur when going outside
of berkeley and to local addresses -- I haven't seem statistics, but
let's say that makes up 15% of total traffic. 

So, continuing to make calculations off the cuff, if your access for
classwork is split 50/50 between ucb/non-ucb sites, you would
experience this speed degredation 50% of the time when using a
non-sprintlink ISP (eg, there are places like earthlink that are on
sprintlink, and a few quick traceroutes shows 60ms-ish return times
&gt;from  them, versus 190ms-ish from netcom), while only 15% of the time
while using a campus modem pool.

Standard disclaimers apply: one would need a much more complex
model. From the perspective of someone who switches between campus and
off-campus providers fairly often, and who rarely notices that much of
a difference, I don't think the issue is that significant in relation
to the other ones here.

&gt;so if you're with an outside isp you may be fighting to get in, but with
&gt;cns you're fighting to get out. either way sprintlink is a headache.

Agreed that sprintlink can be a headache and that we should still
probably drop them. Nevertheless, try some pings from sprintlink and
some local ISPs, or receiving video content and looking at the
statistics, and sprintlink is generally not that bad.

&gt;
&gt;restricting modems to the berkeley.edu domain is a good idea in the sense
&gt;that it would allow easy occaisional access to restricted resources
&gt;(cobweb, site licensed stuff) for those with isp accounts (which would be
&gt;everyone) until the university can develop a secure extranet.
&gt;

So you think it is the university's business to judge what I should
read while using university resources?

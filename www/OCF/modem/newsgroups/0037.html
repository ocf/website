&gt;Well, I already whined about this once on ucb.sysadmin, but what the
&gt;hell, why not flame again?  The 2 hour auto time-out is an ill-conceived
&gt;waste of time.

Maybe, maybe not.  Your long reasoning based on based on theories of
supply &amp; demand and consumer behavior left out several possibilities,
both real-world and theoretical.

For example, you left out any consideration of "behavior modification".  

None of the arguments Jerry raised are new to anyone in CNS, IS&amp;T, or
even at the Vice Chancellor level (at least amongst the people who have
spent any time on this issue).  These arguments, or ones very similar,
are exactly why my decision to impose the 2 hour limit was not universally
admired within CNS.

But anyone who claims to know for a fact that the time limit won't do any
good at all is on pretty shaky ground.  The experiences at other campuses
(and I've just now gotten back from a meeting with network reps from a
couple dozen other universities) suggest that time limits are effective--
albeit only at the margin.  

The only universities which feel they've solved the problem are ones who
sell the service in the $8-15/month range.  That gives enough income to
cover the costs of providing the service.

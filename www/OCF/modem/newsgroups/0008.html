&gt; So how is someone with a 14.4 connection (since that's all you offer)
&gt; supposed to download a large file, say Netscape 4.0 that is something like
&gt; 10 MB in size, if you cut people off after 2 hours?

They could get an FTP program that has resume-download capability (e.g.
CuteFTP, but you'll have to register it first).  Of course, the server
would also have to support that too, but if they're only concerned about
getting Netscape 4.x, certainly their site does.

Of course, if they already -had- Netscape 4.x, they would already have
resume-download functionality (kind of).  It's not as good as FTP, but
it's better than nothing.  I'm sure someone desperate enough for it
could find a friend and transfer it with floppies. =)

Or they could try finding a BBS with the necessary files and use good
ol' Zmodem. =)

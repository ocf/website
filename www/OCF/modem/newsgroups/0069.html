&gt; in any case, the argument that the university should continue to provide
&gt; dial-up internet access because problems with sprintlink often cut off
&gt; berkeley.edu from isps seems to make little sense -- money is going to be
&gt; spent to fix the "sprinltink problem" one way or another,

That seems extremely optimistic.  You know something we don't?

&gt; and until it's fixed one will have problems whether on-campus or
&gt; dailing in from outside berkeley.edu.

Wrong.  If one dials in to a Berkeley campus modem to access Berkeley
campus resources, and dials in to an off-campus provider to access
off-campus resources, then one has no problems regardless of what
Sprintlink does or doesn't do.  I may well pay $10/month for access to
Berkeley modems, in addition to what I pay to my ISP, exactly so that I
can avoid those problems that you say are unavoidable.  (And, yes, that
does have something to do with the fact that the Sprintlink connection
&gt;from  my ISP to Berkeley just crashed while I was composing this message,
and has been completely down for at least five minutes.)

I think you show a remarkable lack of concern for those whose primary
need is to access machines on the Berkeley campus, whether to do their
homework or get their assignments or even waste time in newsgroups like
this one.  (OK, so not many people *need* to do that.)

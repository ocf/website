&gt; I would much prefer the worst service that can be provided free than
&gt; any sort of commercial service run by the university.  I very much
&gt; doubt that the University could provide decent service at a decent
&gt; price, so if you want to pay, go with an ISP.  Consider the last
&gt; proposed plan $100/year, with limited connect time during peak hours.
&gt; How does this compare to an ISP?  Pretty pathetic.  Putting a few on
&gt; it would just make the dial up lines a total waste.
&gt; 

I just wanted to add my 2 cents worth: as far as I understand, there is
one significant advantage in getting connected through the university
modem pool, and that is access to the web sites for which the university
has purchased a site lincence; the one that interests me most is
MathSciNet, but there are others (e.g., Encyclopaedia Britannica).  I
would be willing to go with a commercial ISP and pay my way, if there
were some easy and legal way of me still being able to enjoy access to
these places.  (The key words are easy and legal, I don't want to have
to run a proxy server on my math. dept. account, or anything of that
sort).  I don't know how many people are in the same situation as
myself, but would imagine that this is one of the points that prevents
migration to commercial ISP's.  Maybe implementing this somehow
campus-wide will do more for modem conjestion than any sort of time
limits.

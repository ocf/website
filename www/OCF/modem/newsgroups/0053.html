&gt;&gt; I would think that's the worst solution I've heard yet.  (As well as

&gt;
&gt;I don't understand this remark.  What's technically impossible, or even
&gt;difficult, about a packet filtering solution that only allows
&gt;connections from the modem pool to Berkeley IP addresses?  While I'm not
&gt;particularly supporting the suggestion, I don't understand how this
&gt;would "cut off access" for anyone.

Such a packet filter could be trivially circumvented by using a proxy
server on a berkeley.edu machine (such as the established transend.CS
proxies, or a proxy set up on any of the thousands of *.berkeley.edu
machines outside the control of IS&amp;T, such as those in the dorms, those
run by various departments or student groups, etc.).  You'ld either have
to block access from the modems to those machines, or those machines to
the outside world to prevent this.  While the University could pass a
policy outlawing such things, the whole proposal is completely at odds
with the University's current goals of relying more &amp; more on
information technology, so it's highly unlikely such a policy would
never get passed.

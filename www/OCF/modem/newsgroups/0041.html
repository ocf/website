&gt;The modem scarcity, and the 2-hr limit imposed as an attempt to

&gt;I suggest that the 2-hr limit makes the distribution of an updated BIK on

Ted-

Thanks for your concern about this.  I can tell you that we are aware of the
problems that are caused by the 2 hour time limit and the fact that we are
no longer distributing a BIK for the latest versions of the Mac OS or Windows.
We are looking at various options for eliminating these problems.  As soon
as we have more detials about what we're going to do (it's still pretty
hazy at this point), we will announce it and ask for feedback.

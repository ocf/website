&gt;Maybe, maybe not.  Your long reasoning based on based on theories of
&gt;supply &amp; demand and consumer behavior left out several possibilities,
&gt;both real-world and theoretical.
&gt;
&gt;For example, you left out any consideration of "behavior modification".  
&gt;

True, as I don't believe experience to date holds out a lot of hope
for user behavior modification.  Case in point: it's dead easy to dial
in to campus in the mornings; I haven't noticed people altering their
behavior to make use of that fact, or if they have, it hasn't helped
evening logins.  If CNS is hoping for users to start using the service
less in response to the new policy, I'd allow that you might be right,
but only in the short term.  Given the University's rather active
encouragement of the use of online resources for instruction, I suspect
you'll find that sooner or later, demand for your services simply
isn't elastic enough for use to slack off in response to service
changes.  And I would bet my money on it being sooner.  

I realize that you are more less stuck on this issue, Cliff, with
no good solution in sight.  If this debate accomplishes nothing else,
maybe you can save it to show people in the campus administration to
encourage them to slow down in their pursuit of the all electronic
campus (at least until they're willing to give CNS the money to
adequately support it).  But I've got to say, my opinion of CNS's
service is going to be taking a big hit every time I hear my modem
click off without warning in the middle of an e-mail to my faculty, dean, or
fellow students.

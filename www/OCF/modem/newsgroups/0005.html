&gt;Thanks.  This will probably make it difficult for me to just turn ftp
&gt;and go to sleep,

won't it actually make it easier? you start the ftp and go to sleep,
we'll hang up the phone for you. :-)

&gt;                 but at least I'll be able to get online.

i'll be real interested to hear if that turns out to be true: that
you'll find it easier to get a modem connection.

the 2-hour cutoff is not unanimously supported within CNS. the reality
is, we don't for sure that the 2-hour cutoff will make it easier to
get a connection; some folks are guessing that it won't. on the flip
side, there's no denying the inconvenience of an inflexible cutoff rule.
note too: with our existing technology, there is no way to issue a 1-minute
warning.

the cutoff decision was "handed down from on high." i don't know how high.
i do know that the student campaign got the chancellor's attention, and
that this played a role in the decision, but note that i'm very carefully
not saying that this was the chancellor's decision. i really don't know.

i am pretty confident though, that with one possible exception, the folks
in the decision making chain are not frequent readers of newgroups. infer
what you will about the effectiveness of protest or praise posted here.

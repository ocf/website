: I've thought for a while the ideal solution would be to yell at TCI
: until they expand their @Home cable modem service up to this end of the
: Bay Area (currently it's only available down in Fremont &amp; Sunnyvale I
: believe), and then arrange for a special tie in between @Home &amp; the
: campus network, similar to Metricom's, bypassing SprintLink.  Perhaps if
: the University offered to subsidize some of the costs of setting it up
: or guaranteed a minimum number of subscribers or something...   (If it

or -- and this is likely much cheaper &lt;g&gt; -- you could just yell at
pacbell to hurry up with adsl deployment already ...

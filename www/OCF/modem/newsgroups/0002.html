In article &lt;<a href="mailto:34187270.1FE5EEB8@anon.com">34187270.1FE5EEB8@anon.com</a>&gt;, Chris Hostetter  &lt;me@anon.com&gt; wrote:

Naah; the real problem is the student/modem ratio.

Current ratio is 50/1.  Vice Chancellor of Information Systems admits
that 10/1 is the appropriate ratio.

(For context, industry standard is about 20/1 to 15/1.  Premium ISPs
offer about 10/1 ratios.  University students are logged on more than
most ISP customers, and so need many modems.  Also, for comparison,
back around Christmas when AOL was getting slaughtered by customers
and by the press for not having enough modems, AOL had about a 30/1
ratio.  UCB's current ratio is far worse.)

The problem is that UCB simply isn't allocating enough resources to
Internet access.  (Typical for UCB.)

Until more resources get allocated, and the student/modem ratio is
fixed, any minor tweaks (such as a two-hour timie limit) will be nothing
more than ineffective cosmetic patches.

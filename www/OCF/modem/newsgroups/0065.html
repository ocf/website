&gt; Whether that's a problem of routing or of droping packets is
&gt; debatable, no doubt, but if it takes 190ms to reach an earthlink host
&gt; and 60ms to reach a sprintlink one, I suspect that this is going to
&gt; result in a lot more "slowness" (under most definitions) than any
&gt; problems with dropped packets.

Well, I don't think so at all.  250 ms of (roundtrip) latency is
annoying, but I can live with it.  On the other hand, a link that drops
10% of packets (as sprintlink frequently does) I find more or less
unusable for many purposes.  I guess maybe we just have different
preferences, or are doing different things.  I'll agree that both are
bad; I shouldn't say the latter is the only problem.

&gt; Again, I still think that sprintlink is inferior service; I just think
&gt; that fighting through routing, which occurs all the time, is more
&gt; likely to cause a notable service difference than the problem of
&gt; dropped packets, which, IMHO, is intermittent and relatively rare.

It happens to me all the time lately; I would say most days it is a
problem.  If it were rare, then I wouldn't be complaining about it.

&gt; 
&gt; These are ridiculous losses to those hosts, and if they can be shown
&gt; to be more common than I claim above I will be eating my words soon :)

That looks pretty typical to me.  Need salt?

&gt; I'm not sure why you include BBN Planet in that list; generally I
&gt; considered them absolutely reliable;

Just from my experience with a couple of different east coast customers
connected to BBN Planet.  I frequently experienced severe packet loss
and they didn't seem to be willing to do anything about it, or even
understand the problem.  This was indeed in the days of their growing
pains (I think the sites I'm thinking of were former SURAnet sites?),
and it's entirely possible they have improved their customer service
since then.

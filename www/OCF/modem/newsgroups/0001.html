&gt; dial-up connections beginning Monday September 15.  This means that every
&gt; dial-up connection to the Shared High-speed modem pool (643-9600)* will
&gt; be dropped without notice when the connection reaches the two-hour point.
&gt; You can dial back in immediately to try to get a new connection.

As a person who never uses the high speed modem lines, I still find this
new plan really unfair.

While I understand the need to lessen the load on the Campus modem pool
in an attempt to make the Modems more accessible for all users, I think
a blanket time out of 2 hours will make the modems worthless for doing
anything other then checking mail.

The only thing I can think of that would be more ludicrous, would be if
a sysadmin decided that all users will be automatically logged out of
the machine after 2 hours (they can allways telnet right back in, but
they have to sit and watch that clock constently, making sure they save
their work before teh 2:00 time limit, and make sure they don't have any
programs that will run more then 2 hours
(or maybe machines whose disks are getting full should just start
implimenting rules, that once youve received 2 new email messages, you
have to delete them before you can receive any more)


	If the annex system is bogged down because too many people are logged
on permanently, or because too many people are logged on too long
durring peak hours then address THAT problem.  Make the 2 hour time
limit only durring peak hours, or make the time limit 10 minutes longer
then the average use time.  Don't just punish anyone who needs to do www
reaserch for more then 120 minutes...

If the proposed time limit where a day, I wouldn't object, because
clearly no one is sitting at their computer for 24 hours straight (even
people doing hardcore programming projects have to go to the
refrigerator to get a Jolt-Cola sometime) but the issue is not just
about the length of time.  It's about solving the RIGHT problem.  People
who want to log in for one, 3 hour block to do their homework are not
the ones bogging down the system, it's the people who set their
computers up to log in all day everyday who are tying up the phone
lines, and this time limit is not going to stop those people.
(If you can set your computer up to dial in once a day, you can set it
up to dial in 12 times a day)

	- I'm not in favor of the proposed fee for useing the modem pools, but
I see nothing wrong with putting a weekly, or monthly time quota on
users.  With that type of a system, users could choose whether to use
their (FREE) dialup time all in one block (say for a large homework
assignment) or to spread it around.  

Who knows, maybe people will choose to only log in for 2 hours a time.

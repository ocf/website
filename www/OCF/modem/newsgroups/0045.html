&gt;IS&amp;T has seen 20% cuts in the last two years and students

At what point was this option given to students?

&gt;No one would think of asking the taxpayers to
&gt;foot your phone bill, so why should they pay for your data line?

The obvious response, of course is that I don't use my phone to do my
homework, where I do use University computers via modem to do so.  (I
admit this response ignores the many people using the modems for
non-class-related purposes.)

&gt;The existing modem banks
&gt;will wither by the design of a two-year old order from the Chancellor.

"wither" is a bad choice of words, as it implies their numbers will
shrink, which is exactly the opposite of everything I've heard from
people at all levels in IS&amp;T (which is that they plan to keep the number
basically stable, and in fact have plans to upgrade some of the modems
soon).

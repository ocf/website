<a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/">The Open Computing Facility</a> at 
the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California at
Berkeley</a> will host a free Campus Forum 
on Modem and Internet Access at its next General Meeting on Monday, 
November 17, 1997 at 6pm in Sibley Auditorium on the Berkeley Campus.
<p> 
Anyone interested in the ongoing controversy over modem and Internet 
access for the campus community and the ongoing battle between the 
University and the Associated Students of the University of California
(ASUC) over access to the general modem pools (which allow students,
faculty, and staff to use the Internet free of charge from their home
computers) are invited to come be a part of this lively, interactive 
discussion about the issues, with the people making the policy decisions.
<p> 
A panel of University employees and student leaders working on the issue
will discuss the problems and some future plans and ideas.  A question and 
answer period with the audience will follow the panel discussion.
<p>

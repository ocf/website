<hr>

There are a variety of different e-mail addresses you can mail to contact the
OCF. Each one is answered by a different group of volunteers, who can help in
various ways. In all cases, please remember <b>not</b> to send us your
password over email, as your account will be disabled.

<dd>The most general address - any questions about OCF accounts, services,
	or anything else not covered below should be sent here.  Your mail
	will be seen by all of staff, so will usually be answered much
	faster than if you mail any one staff member.  (And you may get a
	better answer, since all our staff members have different areas of
	expertise, and you may not pick the best one for your question.)

<dd>A small subset of the OCF Staff that manages the OCF World Wide Web server.
	Comments about this site or questions from users setting up pages on
	the site should be mailed here.

<dd>The OCF Site Manager is responsible for running the OCF machines and
	supervising the OCF Staff.  This is the place to mail if you
	would like to <a href="/OCF/staff/how-to-join.html">join OCF Staff</a>,
	or if you have any comments/complaints about the actions of OCF Staff.
	Any staff decision, such as suspending an account for misuse, can be
	appealed to the Site Manager.

<dd>The OCF General Manager is in charge of running the OCF organization,
	and serves as chair of the OCF Board of Directors.  Any 
	administrative matters not related to the running of the OCF computers
	should be sent here.  The General Manager is also the person who
	can hear appeals to overturn any decision of the OCF Site Manager.

<dd>The OCF Board of Directors sets the policies for the OCF, and makes most
	major decisions.  They can also overturn any decision made by the
	OCF Site or General Managers, or OCF Staff.  The Board meets regularly
	during the semester, at times announced in the ucb.org.ocf newsgroup,
	and the login messages on the OCF machines.

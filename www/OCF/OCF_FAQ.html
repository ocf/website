<h1 align=center>Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about the <A HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/OCF/">Open Computing Facility</A></h1>
<hr>

<DT><b>Q:</b> <i>How do I get an OCF account?</i>

<DD><b>A:</b> Go to the OCF computer lab located in Heller Lounge in the
    <A HREF="http://www.berkeley.edu/map/maps/DE34.html"> MLK Student
    Union</A>.  There you will find a stack of account forms in a gray tray 
    immediately on your right upon entering the lab; you will need to take 
    one, complete it and bring it, as well as valid student ID or other proof of
    University affiliation, to an available OCF staff member on duty (please check
    our <A HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/staff_hours"> staff hours</A> for 
    available times.) The staff member will take you through the approval process, 
    eventually asking you to enter a password into the computer. Your account will
    be activated and ready for use a few days after the approval was completed.
<p>

<DT><b>Q:</b> <i>How do I find OCF staff members?</i>
<DD><b>A:</b> Staff members are usually available in the OCF computer 
    lab in Heller Lounge.  Within the lab there is a white board that has a 
    <A HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/staff_hours">schedule</A>
    of when staffers hold their office hours to handle password changing
    or general questions; quite often they are down there at other times though.
<p>

<DT><b>Q:</b> <i>Who can get an OCF account?</i>
<DD><b>A:</b> Any currently registered U.&nbsp;C. Berkeley student or current employee or
    faculty member of the Berkeley campus.  Also eligible are employees of
    groups affiliated with the University such as the Lawrence Berkeley
    Labs, Space Sciences Lab, Math Science Research Institute, and the
    Center for EUV Astrophysics.  Students enrolled in U.&nbsp;C. Extension
    classes on the Berkeley campus, concurrent enrollment programs, or the
    Graduate Theological Union can also get OCF accounts.  Neither alumni
    status nor attendance of another U.&nbsp;C. campus are qualifications for an
    OCF account.
<p>

<DT><b>Q:</b> <i>Where can I use my OCF account?</i>
<DD><b>A:</b> You can login to your account from anywhere you can access 
    the campus computer network, including from 
    <!--a href="http://www.net.berkeley.edu/dcns/modems/"-->a modem on a
home computer</a>, the Mac &amp; PC facilities 
    <a href="http://cafe.berkeley.edu/">around campus</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.rescomp.berkeley.edu/">in the dorms</a>, from
instructional accounts, and from other computer accounts.
<p>

<DT><b>Q:</b> <i>What exactly is the OCF?</i>
<DD><b>A:</b> The OCF is an ASUC-sponsored
    Student-Initiated Service Group</a>.  Our limited funding comes directly
    from the ASUC and our computers are almost completely from donations.
    Our staff is all volunteers (no one is paid a cent) and policies are set
    by the OCF Board of Directors, which is made up of students interested
    in helping provide computing services to the campus community.  The
    Board is always accepting new members; for more information come to a
    meeting (usually held weekly - announced in the login messages) or <A
    HREF="mailto:gm@ocf.berkeley.edu">send e-mail to <tt>gm@ocf</tt></a> (the
    OCF General Manager - the student in charge of running the OCF
    organization).
<p>

<DT><b>Q:</b> <i>What's the difference between OCF and <!--a
href="gopher://uclink.berkeley.edu:70/11/"-->UCLink 1/2/3</a>?</i>
<DD><b>A:</b> If all you want is a place to send and receive e-mail, there isn't much 
    difference.  If you want to do more than e-mail, Usenet news, file
    transfer, and gopher, then you will need an OCF account since UCLink 1, 2, & 3
    accounts are limited to those things, while OCF accounts have very few
    limits as to what you are allowed to do with them.  The other major
    difference that the OCF is run entirely by volunteer students while
    UCLink is an official University run service with paid employees.
<p>

<DT><b>Q:</b> <i>What's the difference between OCF and <!--A
HREF="http://www-uclink.berkeley.edu/"-->UCLink 4</a>?</i>
<DD><b>A:</b> UClink4 is just a central storage location for e-mail.  To do anything
    else (such as read that e-mail) you need to use another computer,
    such as the OCF, one of the campus-network connected Macs & PC's in the
    Microcomputer Facilities, or a home computer capable of running <!--a
href="http://tuna2.berkeley.edu/email.html#Home-IP"--><!--iBerkeley 
Internet Kit--><a 
href="http://cab.berkeley.edu/"><i>Connecting@Berkeley</i></a>
or some other SLIP/PPP software.<p>

<DT><b>Q:</b> <i>Where can I get help if I have any other questions or problems?</i>
<DD><b>A:</b> You can ask OCF staff in person or
    <A HREF="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/OCF/contact.html">send e-mail to 
us</A>.

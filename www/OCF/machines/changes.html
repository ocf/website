<h1 align=center>Changes to the OCF Machines</h1>
<hr>

The OCF is converting from its current <a href=index.html>cluster of
Apollo workstations</a> to a <a href=new-index.html>cluster based
on newer SparcStation computers</a>.  As we go through this migration,
there are a number of things users will notice as we move various services
from the old systems to the new.  We will update this page with information
about the changes as they happen.  If you have any questions about this or
any other matter involving the OCF machines, please feel free to 
<a href="mailto:staff@ocf.berkeley.edu">send mail to staff@ocf</a>.

<h2>Changes already made</h2>

<dl>

<dt>July 17, 1996 

<dd>Home directories have been moved to the disks on the Sparc 20.  Users
will be able to access their directories from the apollos as always.  Since
the Sparc uses SCSI-II disks which are much cheaper (as well as faster and
more reliable) than the ESDI disks used in the Apollos, there is much more
disk space available, so accounts on the Sparcs will have a larger disk quota.
Currently, quotas for home directories that have been moved are set to 4 megs
- the Summer Board of Directors has approved a 5 meg quota total for mail, web
pages, and home directories, so once the other functions are moved to the
sparcs as well, quotas will be adjusted once again.  One word of warning
though:  these quotas are automatically enforced -- the computer will not let
you go very far over your quota, or let you stay over your quota for more
than seven days.
<p>
<dt>July 31, 1996
<dd>All web pages are now being served from the new Sparc 2 web server,
	<tt>death.Berkeley.EDU</tt>.  The new server is faster and much 
	more reliable than the old one.

<p>
<dt>August 24, 1996

<dd>
All mail services have been moved to a new computer -- <tt>mail.OCF.Berkeley.EDU</tt>
The change of mail servers is being done to move the mail processing
software from the current Motorola 68030-powered Apollo to a more
stable and more powerful Sun SparcStation 2.  This should provide
more reliable mail delivery for OCF users instead of the current
overloaded system, as well as much more disk space to store mail.
<p>
<b>Anyone who uses a POP program (Eudora, NuPOP, Netscape, etc.) to read
their OCF mail on another computer should <A href="change-pop.html">change
their settings</a> on that program to connect to the POP and/or SMTP servers
at the address <tt>mail.OCF.Berkeley.EDU</tt> instead of
<tt>ocf.berkeley.edu</tt> or whichever of our disaster-named machines you
currently use.</b>

<h2>Upcoming changes</h2>

<dl>

<dt>New mail services
<dd>The new mail server will soon also provide IMAP mail service,
which is similar to the currently provided POP, but more powerful.
Unlike POP, which has you download all your mail to the computer you
are reading on, IMAP allows you to spend less time on the modem by
letting you choose which messages to download and since it lets you
store & manage your mail on the server, it's more convienient for
those who wish to access their mail from multiple locations (such as
from home, on-campus computer labs, friend's places, work, etc.).
The most popular IMAP client programs at this time is Pine, but IMAP
support is being added to many products under development at this
time such as Netscape Navigator 4.0, Sun Microsystems Solstice Mail,
the next version of NetManage Chameleon, and products from Microsoft,
Lotus, Novell, and many others.  For more information about IMAP, see
<A HREF="http://www.imap.org/">The IMAP Information Center</a>.
<p> 


<dt>Logins to the new sparc computers
<dd>Users cannot yet login to the new computers.  OCF staff is busily working
	to setup the new machines and install all the software our users are
	used to (and many more new programs that the apollos don't currently
	have).

<p>
<dt>New anonymous ftp & gopher server
<dd>The anonymous ftp & gopher servers will soon be moved onto death as well.
	Once this is done, users will be able to make their own anonymous ftp
	areas to distribute files to the world (with some restrictions of course,
	but hopefully not too many).

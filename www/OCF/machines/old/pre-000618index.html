<dt><h3><A HREF="/apollo/">Apollo Domain Workstations</A></h3>
<dd>We've had some Apollos in the past -- since 1988 in fact. They were
our
first lab machines ever. Last year's SM, katster,
sent them all to E&S -- a.k.a. campus salvage. They were simply too old to
be useful. As with time, technology marches on, if less inexorably.

<h2>Printers</h2>
<dl>
<dt>logjam (our high-performance caged beast)
<dd>HP Laserjet 4050N<br>
This baby has 16ppm black and white capabilities with full duplex! You'll
soon be able to use it in our <a href=../../newlab/>New Lab</a>. 

<dt><strike>logjam</strike> (the first one)
<dd>HP Laserjet 4MP<BR>
Our printer was stolen during June, July or August of summer
1999. That's what happens with lax security and no lockdown cabling.
<!--Thus, we are on the lookout for it, as well as new printers. But we
expect
to have DEClasers up and running soon. --></dl>

<h2>More Information</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Everything else
<dd>Most of the equipment listed here is in Heller Lab, MLK Student Union.
The servers are in another building close by. OCF has additional machinery
 that is even slower than what is listed above. Thus, we are always open
to
donations of decent equipment from individuals or corporations, so if you
are thinking about it, please contact us. Contributors will at minimum
receive receipts for their equipment. We are considering other computer
platforms, but that depends on other factors which are being worked
out...<p>

We will take any recent (within a couple years) Sun equipment, as well as
Pentium- and PowerPC-class machines that work.

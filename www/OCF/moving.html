<h1 align=center>The OCF has MOVED!</h1>

<hr>

On April 8, 1996, remodeling began on the space in the basement of
<A HREF="http://server.berkeley.edu/Berkeley/Buildings/evans.html">Evans Hall</A>
that had been the OCF's home since our founding in 1989.  Sometime soon,
the <A HREF="http://math.berkeley.edu">Math Department</A> is expected to
unveil it's new state-of-the-art computer facility there.  Unfortunately,
that meant the OCF had to be somewhere else during the construction, so
we've moved to Rooms 70 and 72 in the basement of <A
HREF="http://server.berkeley.edu/Berkeley/Buildings/barrows.html">Barrows
Hall</A>.

<p>

Since the move, the only difference most users have noticed is
that they are now going to the basement of Barrows Hall when they want to
access our consoles or talk to our staff members. 

<p>

One important change will be noticed by anyone who has used the numeric
addresses of our machines (<i>128.32.184.254</i>, etc.) instead of the
machine names in any configuration files, .rhosts, etc. since the new
location includes new network addresses for the machines.  The names
(<i>earthquake.berkeley.edu</i>, <i>www.ocf.berkeley.edu</i>, etc.) were
changed to the new addresses so people who use the names to connect to our
machines will not be affected.

<p>

If you have any questions about the move or the OCF, please feel free to 
<a HREF="mailto:staff@ocf.berkeley.edu">mail staff@ocf</a> at any time 
or post to the 
<A HREF="news:ucb.org.ocf">ucb.org.ocf newsgroup</A>.
